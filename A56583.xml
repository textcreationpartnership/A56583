            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

to his works, which ought to provoke and ſtir up every Chriſtian to a conſciencious and carefull improvement of his ſtrength, for Gods glory and the ſervice of his generation in this pilgrimage.</p>
            <p>Theſe, among many other motives, prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with me to preſent this Treatiſe to thy view, being alſo preſſed thereunto by many of Gods People, formerly in <hi>England,</hi> and of late in <hi>Ireland,</hi> who have heard me upon the ſame Subject deliver the ſubſtance of what is herein conteined, both in <hi>England,</hi> and in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beloved Reader, I know the World is filled with many Books ſtuffed with very much of mans wiſdome, which, though the Apoſtle ſaith <hi>is enmity againſt God;</hi> yet we find ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes moſt pleaſing to the carnal hearts of men in our age. Therefore if that be the thing that thy itching ears do thirſt after, thou maieſt ſpare thy ſelf that labour, for thou wilt finde that with as much ſimplicity and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as poſſibly I could, I have herein given out by clear Scripture-evidence, what the Lord hath made known to me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:42909:3"/>For the clearing of this weighty point which God by his mighty power hath ſubjected my heart to believe, the which formerly by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of my ignorance and error I was much averſe unto.</p>
            <p>For after it pleaſed God to reveal his Son in me, and to work a change in my heart, the great and weighty thing that God preſented to me was, <hi>to make my calling and election ſure;</hi> which I found to be a work filled with many difficulties, conſidering how far Hypocrites might attain in the profeſſion of godlineſs, and that they might come to have the counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit of all the Grace in the Child of God. And this the rather appeared more difficult, becauſe I found my own heart ſo deſperately wicked and full of deceit, as <hi>Jerem.</hi> 17.9. and alſo found the wiles, and ſubtilties of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, to be various, and I conſtantly under ſeveral temptations, and deep deſertions when God (though for a little ſeaſon) withdrew himſelf, and the light of his countenance from me. At which time, I judged it my onely thing neceſſary to prove whether CHRIST were in me,
<pb facs="tcp:42909:4"/>
and my faith right, as alſo my ſincerity to the Lord. At which time I found but little ſettled reſt or peace, till the Lord had put that great queſtion out of doubt, in giving me a ſure and well grounded confidence of my intereſt in him, till which time, I found little diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſearch narrowly into other truths, which I then thought to be too remote for me to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe my ſelf in, having received ſo much ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual benefit, in communing with God and mine own heart, and ſearching out the difference betwixt the ſpeaking of Gods Spirit, my own ſpirit, and the ſpitit of Satan.</p>
            <p>But when I came to ſome good meaſure of ſettlement in my confident and well grounded hopes, that I was the Lords, then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently was I tempted, touching the main and material fundamental points in Religion; Which temptations, as they were a great cauſe of trouble and reſtleſneſs in my ſoul, ſo they occaſioned me with great eagerneſs, night and day, in uſe of the beſt means God preſented to me, to ſeek ſatisfaction in the ſame, at which time the Lord did carry on my ſoul with much vehemency after him, ſo with much unweari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:42909:4"/>For uſually as one caſe and weighty queſtion was anſwered to my ſatisfaction and comfort, another was ſtated in my ſoul too hard for me, in which experiences I for many years was exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed with all, in which time I was ignorant of the true way, which Chriſt would have his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to walk in.</p>
            <p>But preſently being convinced of the unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantableneſs of the <hi>Government of the Lordly Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, and the Liturgy in the Church of</hi> England, <hi>and the mixed Communions in the Pariſh Aſſemblies,</hi> I was reſolved, God willing, to examine all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as well in worſhip, and the order of Gods houſe, as I had done in other points. But I at this time being by the divine power of God, converted from the <hi>Church of England,</hi> though with a great deal of difficulty, being well furniſhed with arguments from Pulpit and Print, and divers able Diſputants for the defence of that falſe way; but God breaking in by the power of his Spirit with clear Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-light ſubjected my heart to the obedience of the truth, ſo that I found my heart cloſing with thoſe truths in the love thereof.</p>
            <p>At this time many godly Chriſtians going to <hi>New England,</hi> and being come up in my
<pb facs="tcp:42909:5"/>
judgment to the way of <hi>New England</hi> in Faith and order, went over thither, being not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of my error and great darkneſs in ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kling the carnal ſeed of Believers. But verily I thought I had good warrant for that practiſe, having then in ſubſtance the ſame grounds for the defence thereof, that generally to this day is urged for the ſame. Yet having in my heart, ſo clear a light, diſcovering how ſhamefully in many things I had been deluded, and that by thoſe which I could not but have charity to think were the Lords own Servants, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the danger of receiving truths by Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was reſolved to examine that point of <hi>Baptiſm.</hi> And ſo I conſtantly reſorted to the meetings of the people in <hi>New England,</hi> deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to have good ſatisfaction in them, and their doctrine and practice, before I joined in Communion. In order thereunto I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly attended the preaching of the word, where hearing many, often preaching for baptizing of children of believing parents; I began to examine the grounds thereof, and the weight of their arguments, and genuine ſcope and drift of the Scriptures, alleged by them to prove that point, and finding that the

            <p>And then again I found God had not ſo much ingaged by promiſe to reveal himſelf to men, conſidered of ſuch outward and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent parts, but in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 25.14. <hi>The Secrets of the Lord are with them that fear him, and he will ſhew them his Covenant.</hi> And Chriſt ſaith in <hi>John</hi> 15.15. <hi>You are my Friends, if you do whatſoever I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand you; henceforth I call you not Servants, for the Servant knoweth not what his Lord doth; but I have called you Friends, for all things that I have heard of the Father I have made kno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb facs="tcp:42909:7"/>
whether I might not be miſlead; upon which I was put upon humble and fervent prayers to the Lord to guide and teach me, and to reveal his mind to me, having again reſolutions to ſeek the mind of God in this truth, and great incouragements to believe that God would ſatisfy me, and the rather from my former experience of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs having ſatisfyed me in many weighty points that I was every way as much unſettled in.</p>
            <p>Upon which this Temptation came in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh upon me, what need I trouble my ſelf in a point ſo Diſputable, for if by my ſearch and tryall in that matter, I ſhould come to ſee grounds ſwaying in conſcience againſt childrens baptiſm, that then I ſhould be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally diſpiſed, and ſlighted of all the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in that Countrie, and not only be fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of Communion and Fellowſhip with them, but muſt exp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

            <p>Under this Temptation I had a ſore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict,
<pb facs="tcp:42909:7"/>
my evil and treacherous heart reſiſting the bleſſed motions of the Spirit of God, but conſidering that the ground of theſe diſcouraging arguments did ariſe from the fleſh and the Devil, as <hi>Peter</hi> when he ſaid Pity thy ſelf Maſter, this thing ſhall not be to thee, My Reſolution was as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Get thee behind me Satan, thou ſavourest not the things of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which put me in no ſmall agony or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict for ſome good ſpace together; but it pleaſed the Lord to ſet that Scripture home upon my heart, <hi>Buy the truth, and ſell it not,</hi> buy the truth at any rate, but ſell it at no rate, if truth coſt me my life I muſt buy it, though I might have all the favour and friendſhip in the world I muſt not ſell it; this wrought in m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> a grounded and ſettled reſolution, that I would ſeek after the mind of God, as well in ſuffering truths, as other, becauſe Chriſt ſaith, <hi>He that keeps the word of my patience, I will keep him in the hour of Temptation;</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending that to be the words of Chriſts patience, he embracing and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctizing whereof would bring the croſſe (that is, contempt and hatred from all
<pb facs="tcp:42909:8"/>
ſorts of men) I found Chriſt ſaid for this cauſe he was born, and came into the World, to bear witneſs to the truth, theſe things ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, and that from the Lord, that I ought to make diligent ſearch what his mind was in this point.</p>
            <p>Hereupon I found the ſpecial preſence of God with me, carrying out my heart to the Lord by Faith and earneſt Prayer to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed and guided; all which time I was not acquainted with any that oppoſed Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtening children, and converſed onely with ſuch as were for that practice; Finding my carnal part to deſire ſatisfaction in Infant-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm: but the more I conferred with, or heard any preach for it, the more was I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the folly and ignorance of that judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and practice; having heard one man preach fifteen Sermons upon this ſubject, urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that in ſubſtance which many conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Authors had wrote.</p>
            <p>I alſo ſearched many Authors who wrote thereof night and day, with much attention, weighing and examining the grounds they urged, many times breaking my ſleep by watching in the night ſeaſon; at the laſt
<pb facs="tcp:42909:8"/>
it pleaſed the Lord to reveal his mind to me, ſo that I was enlightened in my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to ſee anſwers to whatſoever I had heard, the Lord breaking in with, not onely a clear light in me, as to the matter in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, but three daies one after another, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into my ſoul with ſealing manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Love, and that with ſuch Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſo pertinent and ſutable to my conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. There being a Warrant at this time iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued out to apprehend and bring me before the General Court in <hi>New England</hi> which was no trouble to me, being filled with unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able joy, as I walked up and down in the Woods in that Wilderneſs, about my bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, and this diſcovery from God did much ſettle me in that truth, which in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance thou wilt find in this Treatiſe; Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which God wrought in me a true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and ſorrow of heart, that I had ſo long both in opinion and practice, gone in ſo ſinfull a way, as I found that to be.</p>
            <p>I have not in this Treatiſe gone about to undertake a confutation of any one man, but upon my long experience in this Subject mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, have taken up the main Argument, which
<pb facs="tcp:42909:9"/>
is the foundation that all the reſt are groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon, and have bent my underſtanding in anſwer to that, which being overthrown, all other Arguments fall with it.</p>
            <p>Chriſtian Reader, I judge the clear evidence of Scripture light, which I do hear give out to confirm the Dipping Believers, will be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to reprove all that darkneſs generally aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted in many large Diſcourſes, about this point of chriſtening of children.</p>
            <p>But further, That which I have had much in obſervation hath been a great deal of malice and contempt diſcovered from the devil, againſt this truth.</p>
            <p>Firſt, In that the Devil did by his ſubtilties and fair pretences in the firſt apoſtacy, ſow this error in the minds of people, that this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance was of uſe to regenerate and convey grace, and then who ſhould be thought unfit to receive it, it had been a great unmerciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to let children or any be without the ſame.</p>
            <p>Thus that ſubtle enemy the Devil, deſtroys Gods Ordinances, and ſets up another of his own in the room thereof, which ſtill remains upon the Papiſts, and generally all our carnal
<pb facs="tcp:42909:9"/>
Proteſtants, both Preiſts and people, conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the dangerous eſtate of that child that dies unbaptized, therfore Midwives on this ground were tolerated to baptize if a child were like to dy, putting ſuch a value theron, as if it had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed grace.</p>
            <p>But many good men have renounced this, though the devil hath ſhewed his malice in blinding them ſtill to practice the ſame evil, though upon another ground lately found out, and that is the ſubject this book oppoſeth. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſee the darkneſs and error of Chriſtening carnal children, upon any ground; but the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ſhewes his rage againſt that Ordinance in them, that rather than they will imbrace it as from the Lord, contradict and oppoſe the ſame ſaying, <hi>There is no Ordinance or Church to be found in the world.</hi> His malice alſo appears in ſuch as boaſt of their being above Ordinances, ſaying, <hi>That Chriſt and Ordinances are at end, that dispenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being for that time or age, but now they have Chriſt in Spirit, the ſubſtance being come, the ſhadows vaniſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the Devil ſtrangely appears like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; as if he had forgot his language in the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt</hi> and carnal <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> that this Ordinance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated in the very work done, and that the
<pb facs="tcp:42909:10"/>
ſalvation or damnation depended upon it; when now in others, what is waſhing or dipping in a little water, but a low or legal thing? So that if the Devils deluſions and inventions are not cloſed withal, then Chriſts Ordinances are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified and contemned.</p>
            <p>And further, Satan manifeſts his malice in throwing contempt upon the obedient and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right practiſers of the ſame, to raiſe prejudices from a ſtory of what ſtrange Creatures were of that opinion at <hi>Munſter</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> and ſtirs up others to pry into the dark ſide of the Saints, I mean their perſonal frailties, <hi>As the Egyptians in the Red Sea, to their own deſtructions; the Cloud was darkneſs to them, but gave light to the Iſraelites, Exo.</hi> 14.20. the <hi>Egyptians</hi> eys were only on the black or dark ſide of the Cloud, therfore they ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and fell, but the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had the light part therof for their ſafety, which is compared to the converſation of the Saints <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1. where there is a light part, their graces and virtues, but their dark part is their failings, which malice or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice will not ſuffer many men to ſee beyond; <hi>For a man that hates his brother walks in darkneſs, as John</hi> ſaith; the tempter accuſed <hi>Job, That he did not ſerve God for nought, he was hedged about, God had
<pb facs="tcp:42909:10"/>
prefer'd him to honour and riches and place of authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the world,</hi> as appears in <hi>Job</hi> 29. which malice he now adaies manifeſteth againſt the proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his Saints, deſiring to ſtain their holy o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience with improbrious language of ſelf ſeeking and preferment.

when the Day of <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> was fully come; And according to the promiſe that Jeſus Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them, to wait for, and that <hi>John</hi> had foretold of, <hi>That one ſhould come after him, that ſhould baptize with the Holy Ghoſt, and with fire,</hi> the which was at this time fulfilled, for as the Author of the <hi>Acts</hi> here relates, <hi>Suddenly there came a ſound from Heaven as of a Ruſhing mighty wind, and it filled all the Houſe where they were ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and there appeared unto them Cloven Tongues, like as of fire, and it ſate upon each of them, And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to ſpeak with other Tongues as the Spirit gave them ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance.</hi> Now this I underſtand to be the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm which <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>viz.</hi> that of the Holy Ghoſt, and of fire, which Chriſt ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe, as you may ſee was extraordinary, and upon ſpecial occaſion communicated to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, they being now to give teſtimony of Chriſts Death, Reſurrection, and Aſcenſion. The Lord in order to this work communicates to them the extraordinary Gifts of the holy Ghoſt, and that in an extraordinary manner; For here was outward ſigns, which were cloven Tongues of fire reſting on them; and here was alſo the Holy Ghoſt with the extraordinary Effects of it, as the inward things ſignified by the outward ſign, all which was (I underſtand) extraordinary, for the fitting of theſe Apoſtles to that extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary work which God had to do by them.</p>
            <p>Firſt, They were to be eye-witneſſes of Chriſts Majeſtie in the fleſh.</p>

            <p>Thirdly, They were now to overthrow all the Jewiſh Worſhip, and all the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations, put to an end by Chriſts Death; and to furniſh them to this extraordinary work, which Chriſt, as an effect of his Seſſion at the right hand of God, pours down theſe gifts upon them, as beforementioned; this being noiſed abroad, how they ſpake with other Tongues, the multitude came together, wondring at them, and ſome thought they had been drunk, but <hi>Peter</hi> ſtanding up with the eleven, began to lift up his voice to teach them.</p>
            <p>And firſt,<note place="margin">The Contents of <hi>Peters</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the Jews upon the deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt.</note> He proves by Scripture that theſe gifts of the Holy Ghoſt were formerly promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Lord, and, as an effect of his Aſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> now given to them; and he endeavours in this Sermon preached to prove,</p>
            <p>Firſt, That Jeſus was the Chriſt, a man appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of God by Miracles and Signs, that God did work by him, amongſt them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He endeavours to prove by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that he did ſuffer and dy according to the Counſel and Will of God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That he did riſe again from the Dead, which he from Scripture doth ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie.</p>
            <p>And that in the fourth place, God had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted him <hi>by his right hand to be both Lord and

Chriſt,</hi> and he proves that, by the viſible gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, which they did ſee and hear; and leſt they ſhould not underſtand who he meant, he tells them in the verſe before my Text, <hi>That it was that ſame Jeſus which they had crucified, that God had made Lord and Chriſt.</hi>

               <note place="margin">Who a lawful Miniſter of Baptiſm.</note>Whence you may obſerve, that the perſons bid to go are Diſciples enabled to teach the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel for the converſion of ſouls to faith, and repentance; for it is clear, <hi>That they that are bid to teach; are bid to baptize alſo;</hi> ſo that from this Commiſſion I gather, that a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple enabled to bring down God to a ſoul, and to bring a ſoul again up to God, is a lawful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of Baptiſm; for that is the tenour of the New Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10. <hi>I will be to them a God, and they ſhall be to me a people; and I am my belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veds, and my beloved is mine,</hi> Canticles <hi>c.</hi> 3. ſo that as God in Chriſt is to be opened, and that in all the fundamental Doctrines of faith for mans ſalvation, ſo is the ſouls conformity to God to be preached, as the ſouls duty to God again; ſo that where God hath furniſhed a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter with abilities from himſelf to declare the Doctrine of Faith and Repentance, to converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and having converted that ſoul, is furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with the knowledge of God to teach to

this ſoul all the fundamental Ordinances, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Commiſſion which ſaith, <hi>Teaching them to obſerve whatſoever I have commanded you;</hi> It is without doubt that this is a juſtifiable Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter ſent from the Lord according to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. But though a man ſhould be able to preach the doctrine of Faith, and that ably for the converſion of ſouls unto that faith, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſtitute of the true knowledge of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Baptiſm, and how it ought to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed, to be ſure, this man is not a juſtifiable Miniſter according to the Commiſſion, becauſe he is ignorant of his Commiſſion, that when he hath converted ſouls to the faith, neither knows how to diſcover to theſe men the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Ordinances of God, neither can diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to them the evil of thoſe ſuperſtitious pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, which they have been nurſed up in by the Traditions of their Fathers.</p>
            <p>Yet notwithſtanding I dare not ſay, but ſo far as they have a gift they are warranted to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter the ſame from the firſt of <hi>Peter</hi> 4 10. who ſaith, <hi>Let every one as he hath received the gift Minister,</hi> and ſo it was lawful for any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian man in that ſenſe to adminiſter ſuch gifts which God hath beſtowed on them.</p>
            <p>But ſure it is, That theſe that are utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted how to diſpenſe the Ordinance of Baptiſm, were never ſent of God to diſpenſe it, That inſtead of dipping do ſprinkle, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the true ſubject <hi>A Beleever,</hi> diſpenſe it upon a carnal ignorant child; and inſtead of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42909:17"/>
it into the Name of Father, Son and Holy-Ghoſt, do ſprinkle them at the naming of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny words only.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The true form of Baptiſm.</note>In the ſecond place, the true form of Baptiſm is commanded of the Lord Jeſus by way of dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and, as it were, by drowning, overwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, or burying in Water, and not by ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with water, as appears many waies.</p>
            <p>Firſt, In that although there be frequent men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made of that appointment of Chriſt, in his laſt Will and Teſtament, yet it is never expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the word, that may be rendred Rantiſm or Sprinkling, but by the word that is rendred Baptiſm or Dipping.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In that the word by which it is ſo frequently expreſſed, doth in proper <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſignify to <hi>Dip,</hi> to plunge under water, and as it were to drown them, ſo as with ſafety the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (as to the manner) may be drowned again and again.</p>
            <p>See the inſtance of <hi>Naaman,</hi> who dipped him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſeven times in <hi>Jordan,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5.14. To this ſenſe of the word (at leaſt in this place) both the <hi>Greek, Latine,</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Churches agree, as is affirmed by able Authors.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In that the phraſe in which there is mention made of ſuch an appointment of Chriſt is affirmed, doth neceſſarily import ſuch a thing; and therefore when mention is made of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing, which is commonly tranſlated <hi>in,</hi> or <hi>into,</hi> ſuits with Dipping, and not that Prepoſition, which ſignifies <hi>with,</hi> and ſo ſuits with Sprinkling.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:42909:17"/>And therefore it may be as well rendred, I baptize you <hi>in</hi> Water, and he ſhall baptize you <hi>in</hi> the Holy Spirit, <hi>Mark</hi> 1.8. So it is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, <hi>John</hi> did baptize <hi>in</hi> the Wilderneſs, and <hi>in</hi> the River of <hi>Jordan, ver.</hi> 4, 5. or that <hi>John</hi> was in the Spirit on the Lords day, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.10. And they were baptized <hi>in</hi> the Cloud, and <hi>in</hi> the Sea, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 10. and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. It may as well be rendred, I baptize you, or dip you <hi>into</hi> Water, as it is rendred, they were caſting a Net into the Sea, <hi>Mark</hi> 1.16. for which the words are affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be the ſame, and it would be too impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per a Speech to ſay, <hi>John</hi> did baptize <hi>with</hi> the Wilderneſs, and they were caſting a net <hi>with</hi> the Sea.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That this appointment of Chriſt, is by way of Dipping, and not ſprinkling, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears.</p>
            <p>In that for the reſemblance and likeneſs here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> paſſing under the Cloud, and in the Sea, where the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> that were their Lords and Commanders, their Purſuers and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, that ſought their deſtruction, were drowned, left behind, and ſeen no more, is by the Holy Spirit, called a Baptiſm, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.2. They were baptized in the Cloud.</p>
            <p>Where obſerve, It is not here rendred <hi>with</hi> the Cloud, and <hi>with</hi> the Sea, as in the other place; <hi>Mark</hi> 1.8. <hi>with</hi> Water, becauſe it ſutes with ſprinkling, although the word be the ſame; But <hi>in</hi> the Cloud, and <hi>in</hi> the Sea, which ſutes with Dipping or Over-whelming, and ſo
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42909:18"/>
with the appointment of Chriſt; they paſſing through the midſt of the Red, or bloody Sea, on dry land, which ſtood on both ſides as a Wall, and being under the Cloud as men (in a carnal eye) overwhelmed and drowned, and yet truly ſaved, and ſafe from their Enemies.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, That this appointment of Chriſt, was not by ſprinkling, but by dipping or putting the perſon into, or under Water, appears by <hi>Philips</hi> baptizing the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> It is ſaid, They went both down into the Water; both <hi>Philip</hi> the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizer, and the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> that was the perſon, to be baptized; and being there in the water, <hi>Philip</hi> baptized or dipped him in that water, as <hi>John</hi> did Jeſus in the River of <hi>Jordan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it is ſaid, They deſcended, or went down into the water, ſo they aſcended or went ſtraight way up, or out of the water, ſee for this <hi>Acts</hi> 8.38, 39. <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.16. Mark the expreſſion, <hi>And Jeſus when he was baptized went up ſtraightway out of the Water,</hi> therefore he had been down in the water.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, That this appointment of Chriſt, was not by ſprinkling, but by dipping, or as it were a drowning, appears, in that <hi>John</hi> the Baptizer (his work being to baptize) remains in the Wilderneſs by the River of <hi>Jordan,</hi> and afterwards in <hi>Enon,</hi> near <hi>Salem,</hi> and the reaſon that is rendred, by the Spirit of the Lord, why he abode there, was, becauſe there was much water, which need not have been, if that appointment could have been performed by
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42909:18"/>
ſprinkling and not by dipping, See <hi>Luke</hi> 3.2, 3. <hi>John</hi> 3. &amp; 23.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, That this appointment of Chriſt was not to be performed by ſprinkling, but by dipping, appears from the nature of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance it ſelf; for it is ſuch an Ordinance as whereby the perſon that ſubmitteth thereto, doth viſibly put on Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, and is hereby viſibly planted into his Death, holding forth therein a lively ſimilitude and likeneſs unto his Death, whereby only through faith, he now profeſſeth he hath eſcaped death, and is in hopes to obtain life everlaſting, and ſo to have fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with him in his Death, and to reckon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf dead with him to ſin, Sathan, the Law, and the Curſe, See <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.2, 3, 5, 7. &amp; 9. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.29.</p>
            <p>But the planting of a perſon into the likeneſſe <hi>of death, is no way reſembled by ſprinkling; but by dipping, it is lively ſet forth and demonstrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Eighthly, This appointment of Chriſts bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, is an Ordinance whereby the perſon that ſubmitteth thereto, doth hereby viſibly and clearly reſemble the burial of Chriſt, and his being buried, in reſpect of the old man, the former Luſts and Corruptions (like the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>) to be taken away and ſeen no more, See <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4, 6. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12. But ſprinkling doth no way lively reſemble the Burial of Chriſt, or the perſon being buried with him, as Dipping doth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:42909:19"/>Ninthly, This appointment of Chriſts bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is an Ordinance, whereby the perſon that ſubmitteth thereto, doth viſibly and lively hold forth herein the Reſurrection of Chriſt, declares him, whoſe life was taken away from the earth, to be alive again, who although he dyed and was buried, yet was not left in the grave to ſee corruption, but was raiſed again, and behold he liveth for evermore.</p>
            <p>And as hereby he holds forth the Reſurrection of Chriſt, ſo doth he alſo his own, being planted in the likeneſs thereof, ſo as to reckon himſelf to be in Soul and Spirit, quickned and riſen with Chriſt, from henceforth to live unto God the Fountain of Life, and Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, who dyed for him, and roſe again, and ſo to walk in newneſs of life in this preſent world, being alſo begot into a lively hope, that in the world to come, he ſhall be raiſed and quickned both in ſoul and body, to a life everlaſting, See <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4, 5, 8, 11. <hi>Acts</hi> 8.33, 35, 36. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.29. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3.</p>
            <p>But ſprinkling doth no way lively reſemble the reſurrection of Chriſt, or the Soul or bodies riſing, or being raiſed by him, as the way of dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping doth.</p>
            <p>Therefore this appointment of Chriſt, was and ſtill is to be performed by way of dipping or put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the perſon into, or under the water, and not by ſprinkling.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, Dipping doth hold forth a confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to Chriſt in his ſufferings and afflictions, as
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42909:19"/>
Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I have a Baptiſm; and how am I ſtreightned until it be accompliſhed,</hi> meaning his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</p>
            <p>Now one end of Baptiſm is, to repreſent Chriſts Sufferings, and our Sufferings with him, which is in a lively manner ſet out by dipping into water, and therefore when the Saints do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs their afflictions, they do ſet them forth by being in the depths, or in the deep waters, as <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 130. <hi>Out of the depths have I cryed unto the Lord,</hi> meaning deep afflictions, and God ſaith in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 43.2. <hi>When thou paſſest through the Waters, they ſhall not overflow thee,</hi> meaning affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and therefore a believer, is to be dipped and plunged, all over into the River or water, to hold forth, That now he muſt reſolve to take up the Croſs of Chriſt and ſuffer; and not only ſo, but this being raiſed and delivered out of the water again by the hands of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, doth hold forth, that ſo ſhall ſuch believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſouls be ſaved, and delivered from all their afflictions, as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.17. <hi>Many are the Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the righteous, but God ſhall deliver them out of all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that this doth ſign or ſignify our ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, appears, in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21 the like figure wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto Baptiſm doth now ſave us and <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>He that believes and is baptized ſhall be ſaved;</hi> So that Baptiſm is to ſign, and confirm ſignally our Sufferings and Afflictions with Chriſt, ſo Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Deliverance from them all, the one in dipping and plunging him in Water, the other in Raiſing him out again.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:42909:20"/>
               <note place="margin">Into whoſe name Baptiſm is adminiſtred</note>The third thing that is eſſential in this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Baptiſm, which I ſhall ſpeak to, will be what is meant by name of <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> The Command is, That the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter muſt dip them into the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, the which the Lord Jeſus commanding muſt be therefore eſſential to this Ordinance, I ſhall therefore endeavour to ſhew you what is meant by name here.</p>
            <p>That by which Father, Son, and Spirit are made known, as a man is by his Name, that is hereto be underſtood, by the name Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, we know the Goſpel doth hold forth one God, yet diſtinquiſhed into Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, the name here is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, that Goſpel that doth ſo ſet forth God and deſcribe him as the Subject Matter of our Faith, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.15. <hi>But the Lord ſaid unto</hi> Ananias, <hi>Go thy way, for he is a choſen Veſſel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and Kings, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael, for I will ſhew him how great things he must ſuffer for my names ſake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now Name in this place, and in the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is to be underſtood, that heavenly myſtery of the Goſpel, in which God is diſcovered and made known, as a man by his name.</p>
            <p>One part of the Goſpel myſtery conſiſts of a Diſcovery of the name of the Father, by which he is diſtinquiſhably made known from the Son and Spirit, and that in theſe particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, In ordaining the Son, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18. in chooſing and electing the Son, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 28.16.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:42909:20"/>

This I underſtand is the Name of the Father.</p>
            <p>And by the Sons Name is to be underſtood, that by which he makes known himſelf to the Sons and Daughters of men, as to take Fleſh, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 1.3. He kept the Law in order to dy, As that juſt one, or as a Lamb without ſpot, and his making his Soul an offering for ſin, as a perfect offering for the ſins and tranſgreſſions of his people, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.12, 14. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. and that he did not only dy for our Sins, but roſe again for our Juſtification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.25. and aſcended into Heaven, and makes interceſſion for us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.25. And pours down the Spirit and gives gifts unto men, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.10, 11, 12. all this the Son makes himſelf known by as by a name, diſtinguiſhably from the Father, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
            <p>And in the laſt place, the Spirit is made known in the Goſpel, as that which in the firſt place convinceth the world of ſin, <hi>John</hi> 16.8. and pricks men in their hearts with a ſenſe of ſin, and the wrath of God due for ſin, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37. <hi>&amp;</hi> 29. And the work of the Spirit, by which that is made known, Is the revealing of the Father, and the Son, and thoſe great Myſteries unto the ſoul of a poor convicted Sinner, for as Chriſt
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:42909:21"/>
ſaith, the Spirit of God ſhall lead you into all truth, it ſhall take of mine, and ſhew it to you, <hi>John</hi> 16. and ſo no man doth underſtand, the things of a man, but the Spirit of a man, that is within him; So none ſhall or can underſtand the things of God, but by the Spirit of God; for the Spirit of God ſearcheth out all things, even the deep things of God 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9, 10. The Spirit doth not only diſcover mans miſery, and his loſt eſtate by reaſon of ſin, but diſcovers a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy which lies in the great love of God in Chriſt (as before mentioned) and worketh in the heart, true faith and repentance, diſpoſing the heart to obedience, This is the proper work or office of the Spirit, by which he is diſtinguiſhably known from the Father and the Son.</p>
            <p>And now, when the Soul ſhall come to the Preacher, and make known to him, that the Spirit hath experimentally made known unto him his loſt and damnable eſtate by ſin, and that he ſame Spirit hath diſcovered unto him, the great love of God the Father, in the gift of Chriſt, to be a propitiation for ſin, as one dying for the chief of Sinners, and that the Spirit of God hath made known all this to him, and hath wrought faith in his heart to believe it, and hath changed his heart from a Courſe of ſin, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed obedience; for no ſoul can declare to a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the true work of Converſion, but he muſt in ſo doing diſcover his knowledge of the work of the Father, Son and Spirit, and into this doth the Miniſter baptize him, as in the name of the

            </p>
            <p>And he by the great authority which (as an extraordinary Apoſtle) he had from Heaven, commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jeſus. So we find <hi>Ananias</hi> in a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner ſent to the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> at his firſt converſion to the faith, as <hi>Acts</hi> 22.16. where he alſo by the authority received from Chriſt in verſe the 16. ſaith, <hi>And now</hi> Paul <hi>why tarrieſt thou?

            <p>And in the next place, As God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Miniſters to baptize or dip Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers only, and as his Miniſters (by virtue of that authority from him) have left ſtanding Laws, and commands upon Diſciples only to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, ſo we find, that they did practice that way and that only; of baptizing ſuch as believed and repented, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.40, 41, 42. <hi>So many as glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received the word, were baptized, and the ſame day there were added to the Church, three thouſand ſouls, And they continued in the Apostles Doctrine, Fellowſhip, Breaking of Bread, and Prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VVhence you may obſerve the practice of the Apoſtles that were guided by the infallible gifts of the Spirit, that firſt they converted before they baptized.</p>
            <p>In like manner you ſhlla find in <hi>Acts</hi> 8.12, 13.

where <hi>Philip</hi> was preaching to the people in <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria, But when they believed</hi> (he preaching the things concerning the Kingdom of God, and the name of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>they were baptized both Men and Women, Then</hi> Simon <hi>himſelf believed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; and when he was baptized, he continued with</hi> Philip <hi>and wondered.</hi> So that you ſee this was the continued courſe of Chriſts Meſſengers ſent by him.</p>
            <p>Firſt, They converted men by preaching, and then baptized them, In the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, or in the name of the Lord Jeſus, wherein the name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Spirit are included, when his name is only mentioned. In like manner you ſhall find in the ſame <hi>Chap.</hi> that <hi>Philip</hi> (by the Spirit of the Lord, being directed to the <hi>Eunuch</hi> that did belong to <hi>Candace</hi> the Queen of the <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> who had the charge of all her Treaſure, and had been at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for to worſhip, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning, and reading <hi>Iſaiah</hi> the Prophet, then <hi>Philip</hi> joined himſelf to his Chariot, and upon ſome diſcourſe together, he from the aforeſaid Scripture, preached unto him Jeſus, in <hi>Acts</hi> 8.32, &amp;c. <hi>And as they went on their way they came to a certain Water, and the Eunuch ſaid, See, here is Water, what hindereth me to be baptized?</hi> Philip <hi>ſaid, If thou believeſt with all thy heart it is lawful,</hi> (implying it was unlawful for a man (not belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving) to be baptized, <hi>And he anſwered and ſaid, I believe that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God, and he commanded the Chariot o ſtand ſtill, and they went
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:42909:23"/>
both down into the Water, both</hi> Philip <hi>and the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch, and he baptized him, and when they were come out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away</hi> Philip <hi>that the Eunuch ſaw him no more, and he went on his way rejoicing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From all theſe words you may obſerve, That <hi>Philip</hi> is ſaid to preach Chriſt unto this man, and upon his comming to the water he ſaid, What lets?<note place="margin">Believers ſhould offer themſelves to be baptized.</note> where you ſee, It is the duty of ſuch as believe to offer themſelves to be baptized, and that there is no let or hinderance to the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Baptiſm but unbelief, and therefore ſaith he, <hi>If thou believeſt with all thy heart thou mayeſt,</hi> (or it is lawful, as the word more proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may be read) plainly holding forth, that all both young and old, that did not believe, it was unlawful for them to be baptized.</p>
            <p>And you ſhall find ſeveral families alſo bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed upon their being converted, which many (through ignorance and want of taking notice of what the Scripture ſpeaks) ſay, it is probable, they had ſome Infants in them.</p>
            <p>But to prevent miſtakes in the minds of any that ſo think, I ſhall prove, That theſe families were all converted Diſciples ſo as to believe the Goſpel; as for inſtance, Firſt the Family of <hi>Lydia, Acts</hi> 16.14, 15. <hi>And a certain women na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi> Lydia, <hi>a Seller of Purple, of the City</hi> Thiaty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra <hi>(which worſhipped God) heard us, whoſe heart the Lord opened, that ſhe attended to the things which were ſpoken of</hi> Paul, <hi>and when ſhe was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, and her houſhold, ſhe beſought us, ſaying,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:42909:23"/>
If ye judge me faithful to the Lord, come into my houſe and abide, and ſhe constrained us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now here in this Text,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lydia</hi> and her houſhold to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.</note> 
               <hi>Lydia</hi> is only menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned as to have been converted, no mention made, what her houſhold was, only that they were baptized, but in the laſt verſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the 40. of that Chapter, It is ſaid, That when <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Sylas</hi> were put out of the <hi>Gaolers</hi> houſe, they went and entered into the houſe of <hi>Lydia,</hi> and when they had ſeen the Brethren they comforted them and departed, where you may clearly ſee, That <hi>Lydia's</hi> houſe conſiſted of Brethren, capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being viſited and comforted by <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Sylas,</hi> as well as <hi>Lydia</hi> whoſe houſhold they were.</p>
            <p>And alſo in the ſame Chapter you have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made of the Gaoler and his Houſhold,<note place="margin">The Gaoler and his houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold together converted.</note> all which were baptized in the 31, 32, 33, and 34.

            </p>
            <p>Where it is plain, That the whole houſhold of the Gaoler heard the word of God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced, and believed as well as the Gaoler, and were all baptized, Which is a clear proof, that ſuch hearing the word of God, and believing ought, and they only, to be baptized.</p>
            <p>And this will appear further by the houſe of <hi>Stephanus,</hi> comparing the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>6.<note place="margin">

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:42909:24"/>
where in the one place it is ſaid, that <hi>Paul</hi> bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized the houſhold of <hi>Stephanus,</hi> in the laſt place he ſpeaketh thus, <hi>I beſeech you Brethren, Ye know the Houſe of</hi> Stephanus, <hi>that it is the first fruits of</hi> Achaia, <hi>and that they have addicted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Miniſtery of the Saints, That you ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit your ſelves unto ſuch, and to every one that hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth with us and laboureth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where you ſee in one and the ſame Epiſtle (as he ſaith) he baptizeth this houſhold, ſo he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms they were the firſt fruits of <hi>Achaia,</hi> and that they were Miniſters, and addicted themſelves to the Miniſtring unto Saints, they did as the Text notes, labour, and he would have the Church ſubmit themſelves unto ſuch, therefore they were not babes, or little infants, but all true Converts, believing and penitent perſons.</p>
            <p>And in <hi>Acts</hi> 18.8. for the further clearing of this Matter in hand, <hi>And</hi> Criſpus <hi>the Chief Ruler of the Synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his houſe, and many of the</hi> Corinthians <hi>believed, and were baptized:</hi> So that you ſee what a Catalogue of clear examples you have to confirm unto us, which way thoſe infallible Apoſtles, both taught and practized, according to the great Commiſſion given them, by the Authority of Chriſt from Heaven, To preach firſt the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to every Creature, and he that believeth and is baptized, ſhould be ſaved, and that they ſhould make diſciples through teaching, dipping them into the name of the Father, Son and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt; And withall you ſee both Commands
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:42909:24"/>
as you have heard, and plentiful examples for baptizing believers. But not the leaſt colour or ſhew of any ground for ſprinkling of Infants.</p>
            <p>Now by the way, let me ſay, what a ſad thing therefore is this, that ſuch a world of People (from Cuſtome and Tradition) run headlong after this Idol of mans invention?</p>
            <p>But this Solemn Ordinance which you have heard, lies clearly as a Duty under the expreſs Law of Chriſt to every one that believeth, this they ſleight and contemn, as enemies to the ſame, therefore let ſuch ſouls know, That as Chriſt is a King, So this is one of his great Laws, and a fundamental ordinance of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel unto which he calls all believing and peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent perſons, that are profeſſed ſubjects to him to be obedient to.</p>
            <p>Now therefore let ſuch tender ſouls who have the fear of God in them, lay this to heart.</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">The Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm long neglected, and an Idol ſet in its room.</note> That this Solemn Ordinance for many hundred years, hath been neither preached, nor practiſed, by abundance of ſuch which (in Charity) we cannot but judge, might have many good things found in them.</p>
            <p>But here lyes that which makes the caſe ſad and lamentable, that in the room of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Ordinance of God (which Chriſt confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by his blood) ſhould be ſet up, that Idol of ſprinkling of Carnal poor Infants, for doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, if there be an Idol now practiſed in the world, or ſet up amongſt men, this muſt needs be one, For I have learned, with others of the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:42909:25"/>
Saints of God, this to be an Idol, either the worſhipping of a falſe God, or the true God in a falſe manner, which I might largely inſiſt upon to prove from Scripture.</p>
            <p>Now though this be not an Idol of the firſt kind, it is without doubt an Idol of the ſecond. It is ſetting up mans Invention, inſtead of Gods ſolemn Ordinance, which is a ſin, for which God plagued the people in <hi>Levit</hi> 10. and 1, 2. It is an Image of true Baptiſm ſet up in the room of it, but not the ſame, and that in all the before mentioned eſſentials, A falſe Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrator, ignorant of the true nature of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, inſtead of a true Miniſter; Sprinkling inſtead of dipping; A carnal infant inſtead of a true believing man or woman; And all this done at the naming of ſo many words only; VVhereas the Commiſſion injoins, that they ſhould dip them, in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt. So that there is in this chriſtening of Children, nothing of Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment or of what he commanded, <hi>viz.</hi> The Miniſter wrong, the Subject wrong. the Form wrong, and alſo the naming of ſo many w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rds only inſtead of dipping into the name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Son and Holy Ghoſt, VVhereas the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion injoins, the true Miniſter ſhould dip a Diſciple into the name of Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>Now let any Soul ſeriouſly judge? whether God can own that which hath nothing of his own appointment or Commands, but in every particular contrary thereunto.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:42909:25"/>But ſeeing the main thing uſually controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted is about the Subject (whether Infant or Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever) I ſhall leave what I have ſaid,<note place="margin">The Papiſts do hold that the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey grace by the very work done, which is ſo generally confuted by all Proteſtant Authors, that I think it not worth my time to ſpeak to that groſſe Error.</note> conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Adminiſtration upon Children cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt in all the three foreſaid heads as well as in the laſt, and ſhall ſpeak of the laſt only, <hi>viz.</hi> That carnal children are not lawful Subjects of baptiſm, and ſhall begin to ſpeak to the main Argument or ground, uſually pleaded by all except Papiſts, for Childrens baptiſm, and that is,</p>
            <p>Though there be no command nor example, yet there is a conſequence, <hi>viz.</hi> the Covenant of life being made to Believers, and their ſeed comming out of their loins, Baptiſm, being an Ordinance of that Covenant, doth alſo belong to them.</p>
            <p>Now I ſhall endeavour to prove the falſeneſs and erroneouſneſs of this Conſequence.<note place="margin">The Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of life not made to the ſeed of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers as co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming out of their loins, &amp; therefore the baptiſm of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants drawn thence by a falſe conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</note> That it cannot be of God, my firſt ground is, becauſe it doth oppoſe it ſelf to the expreſs Laws, and Commands of the New Teſtament; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever conſequence men do draw from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that croſſeth the plain Commands of God (to be ſure) cannot be of God, but ſuch conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence muſt needs be (according to Scripture light) of Satan, or at the beſt, from the viſion of a mans own heart.</p>
            <p>Now this I would have you ſeriouſly to take notice of, That baptiſm of Believers, is a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Ordinance of the new Teſtament, enjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by divers ſpecial commands, and incouraged
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:42909:26"/>
with promiſes of remiſſion of ſins and ſalvation on the right performance of the ſame.</p>
            <p>Now for any man to force a Conſequence that ſhall oppoſe it ſelf againſt ſo ſolemn an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance cannot be of God, becauſe God cannot ſpeak that which is contrary to himſelf or to his own commands, As for inſtance:</p>
            <p>When Chriſt began to teach to his Diſciples, that the Son of man muſt ſuffer many things and be rejected of the Elders, and chief Prieſts and Scribes, and be killed, and the third day riſe, He ſpake that ſaying openly, and <hi>Peter</hi> took him and began to rebuke him, but he rebuked <hi>Peter,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Get thee behind me Satan.</hi> From whence we may obſerve,</p>
            <p>That whatſoever conſequence or Argument any man ſhall ſeem to inforce (though preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Scripture for the ſame) that oppoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt duty, or do hinder the ſervants of God therein I may ſay of ſuch Conſequences, and ſuch Arguments, G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t thee behind me Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, thou art an offence unro me: Its clear, That Chriſt concludes thoſe Arguments and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, whatſoever they be that do tend to the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance of any ſolemn duty or Ordinance of God, they are of the Devil, <hi>Get thee behind me Satan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore all thoſe Books and Arguments ſet out for the maintenance of Childrens Baptiſm grounded upon this Conſequence, oppoſing themſelves againſt duty, as you have heard, which is,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:42909:26"/>That every penitent or believing perſon ought to be baptized.</p>
            <p>Now the whole tendency of thoſe Books be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to oppoſe the practic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of the ſame, and to hinder it; I may ſay of them as Chriſt ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>&amp;c</hi> For upon this ground we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all thoſe Diſcourſes not to be of God, I ſhall therefore leave what is ſaid to you, ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to weigh, whether or no this is not an errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſequence.</p>
            <p>But in the next place, let us come nearer to examine this conſequence, both in its ſelf, and the grounds from whence it is drawn.</p>
            <p>The grounds of this Conſequence is, That the Covenant of Grace, belongs to believers Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, the conſequence is therefore Baptiſm, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Ordinance of that Covenant muſt needs belong to believers children, in which two lyes our whole buſineſs, for the grounds of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, is brought the Covenant of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, that belonging to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed after him in their generation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. and 10. to 14.</p>
            <p>From hence it is gathered, That the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, <hi>viz.</hi> of eternal life, belongs to believers and their ſeed born of their body, For the Covenant God made to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his off-ſpring, <hi>viz.</hi> the Covenant of Circumciſion belonging to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed in their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, therefore Circumciſion the ſign of the Covenant belonged to them, ſo the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant now belongs to believing Gentiles and their ſeed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:42909:27"/>Baptiſm being an Ordinance of that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, belongs alſo to believing Gentiles, and their ſeed, this being the onely and alone foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation ground of all thoſe (except Papiſts) for their Rantizing or Sprinkling of Children.</p>
            <p>We ſhall endeavour to prove this ground (from whence this conſequence flows) to be ſo far from being the truth, that it is an error, and yea ſuch an error, that if it were maintained with all thoſe errors, that naturally muſt needs be defended as conſequences of this opinion, it would ſhake the foundations of the Goſpel, But that I may with as much clear ſatisfaction inform others as God had clearly convinced my own ſoul of the truth of this; I ſhall propound this method to be handled.</p>
            <p>Firſt, then I ſhall make it appear to you, That there is two Covenants held forth in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the one a Covenant of Grace, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Covenant of Works, or an abſolute Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and a Conditional Covenant.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I ſhall prove, that the Covenant of Circumciſion was no Covenant of eternal life, but a Conditional Covenant, a Covenant of Works.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I ſhall prove, that none but believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ever had; or ſhall have right to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, I ſhall endeavour to anſwer ſuch Scriptures (eſpecially thoſe in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) that are uſually alleged for defence of a Covenant of life in the fleſh.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:42909:27"/>To the firſt, That there is two Covenants mentioned in Scripture, is very plain, The one a Covenant of eternal life, the other a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of works,<note place="margin">Two Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, the one of Works, the other of Grace or the one the Old, the other the New.</note> in which eternal life was not conveyed or given, as appears in <hi>Jeremiah</hi> 31.32, 33, 34. <hi>But behold the day commeth, ſaith the Lord, that I will make a new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and with the houſe of</hi> Judah, <hi>not according to the Covenant that I made with their Fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the Land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>which my Covenant they brake, although I was to them an husband ſaith the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But this ſhall be the Covenant that I will make with the houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>after thoſe daies, ſaith the Lord, I will put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts and will be their God, and they ſhall be my people, and they ſhall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, ſaying, know the Lord; for they ſhall all know me from the leaſt of them unto the greatest of them, ſaith the Lord, for I will forgive their Iniquities and remember their ſins no more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You have here ſet forth two Covenants, the one Old, the other New, and as here we find a New and Old Covenant, ſo there is likewiſe, mention of two Covenants in the eighth to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> where you have upon the matter the very ſame words, only it is clear, that Jeſus Chriſt is the Miniſter of the New Covenant, in the 6. and 7. verſes of that chap. <hi>But now hath he obtained a more excellent Ministery, by how much
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:42909:28"/>
alſo he is the Mediator of a better Covenant, which was establiſhed upon better promiſes,</hi> for if that firſt Covenant had been faultleſs, there would no place have been ſought for the ſecond.</p>
            <p>In which place we may underſtand two Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, a new Covenant and an old Covenant, and Jeſus Chriſt holding himſelf to be the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Miniſter of the New Covenant, (unto the Church then gathered) all thoſe that are in Chriſt, being Gods <hi>Iſrael, Abrahams</hi> ſeed.</p>
            <p>If you be in Chriſt then are ye <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, and heirs according to promiſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end. So that thoſe that are Chriſts, have this Covenant now made to them, and it appears at the 3. verſe, that the other Covenant was a meer Covenant of works, in that he ſaith, he hath made the firſt old.</p>
            <p>And now that which waxeth old, is ready to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh away, where by old Covenant he means, that typical Covenant of works, which run up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the fleſhly line of <hi>Abraham,</hi> till Chriſt came out of the fleſh of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſo put an end to that Covenant in the fleſh, and this you have further proved in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15, 16. There is again mention made of two Covenants or Teſtaments, the firſt and ſecond, the firſt was confirmed by the blood of Goats and Calves, the ſecond by the blood of Chriſt: Now if any pleaſe but to ſearch theſe Scriptures it will appear that there is two real diſtinct Covenants or Teſtaments, the one of Grace, and the other of works, the one conditional, the other abſolute. Now an
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:42909:28"/>
abſolute Covenant, is a Covenant without all Condition required in the Creature, but what God himſelf performs, as <hi>Jerem.</hi> 32.40. <hi>I will make an everlaſting Covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them to do them good, but I will put my fear in their hearts that they ſhall not depart from me;</hi> Where you ſee, God undertakes both; firſt, that he will not leave or forſake his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but do them good; and ſecondly, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes that he will plant his fear in their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from him.</p>
            <p>And as in that eighth of <hi>Heb.</hi> he engaged that he will write his Law in their hearts, and that he will be their God, and they ſhall be his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and that he will teach them to know him, and will pardon their iniquities, and their ſins he will remember no more.</p>
            <p>Now here is nothing but what God hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken to perform, and to work in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as further appears in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 16. latter end. For thus ſaith the Lord God, I will even deal with thee as thou haſt done, which haſt diſpiſed the oath in breaking the Covenant, Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I will remember my covenant with thee in the day of thy youth, and I will eſtabliſh unto thee an everlaſting covenant, and as he ſaith af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, not by thy covenant, but by my co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, ſo that which he calls thy covenant, was that which they broke, and therein diſpiſed the Oath as he ſaith plainly; holding forth that it was a covenant of works anſwerable to that in <hi>Nehemiah</hi> 10.29. <hi>They clave to their Brethren the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:42909:29"/>
Nobles, and entered into a curſe and an oath to walk in Gods Law, which was given by</hi> Moſes <hi>the ſervant of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which caſe you may diſcern here was two covenants, the one, that God calls his cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and another, that was their covenant, a covenant of works which they broke. And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe you have further the covenant of eternal life, opened in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 36.25, 26, 27. <hi>Then will I ſprinkle clean water upon you, and you ſhall be clean from all your filthineſs, and from your Idols will I cleanſe you. A new heart alſo will I give you, and a new Spirit will I put within you, and I will take away the Stony heart out of your fleſh, and will give you a heart of fleſh, and I will put my Spirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my Statutes, and you ſhall keep my Judgements and do them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where you have, as I ſaid before, this New covenant wholly lying on Gods part, that he would firſt cleanſe them from all their Idols and iniquities, that he undertakes to give a new heart, to take away the heart of Stone, and to give them hearts of fleſh. And that he will give the ſoul his own Spirit, and thereby came theſe to walk in his ways whom he calls to the obedience of his truth.</p>
            <p>If they ſin, he binds himſelf to pardon their ſins, and to remember their ſins and tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons no more, ſo that it is impoſſible that this covenant ſhould be broke, or that a ſoul ſhall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver miſcarry, that is once in this covenant, as in reſpect of his everlaſting eſtate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:42909:29"/>And to this purpoſe, <hi>David very eminently ſpeaks</hi> in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. and 5. verſe, <hi>Although my houſe he not ſo with God, yet he hath made with me an Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant, ordered in all things and ſure, for this is all my ſalvation, and all my deſire, although he make it not to grow.</hi> Where you have <hi>David</hi> ſetting out the Covenant of Grace, and the mercies in it to be in all points perfect and ſure.</p>
            <p>And to this purpoſe the Prophet in the 55. of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and the third verſe, inviting ſouls, and perſwading them to come to Chriſt, ſaith, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline your ear, and come unto me; Hear and and your ſouls ſhall live, and I will make an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant with you, even the ſure mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of <hi>David,</hi> that is, he will give a Soul thoſe New Covenant mercies, which are moſt ſure, no way depending upon any condition to be performed in the Creature, but wholly upon the Lord, as appears in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 89.28. to the 37. ver. <hi>My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my Covenant ſhall ſtand faſt with him; his ſeed alſo will I make to endure for ever, and his throne as the days of Heaven.

            </p>
            <p>Now in theſe words you have the Covenant of eternal life made with Chriſt and his ſpiritual ſeed which <hi>David</hi> and his ſeed were types of, which Covenant is a ſure Covenant, to all thoſe to whom it is once made, and to this doth the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> allude, when he ſaith in <hi>chap.</hi> 6.17, 18. Wherein God willing more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly to ſhew unto the heirs of promiſe, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutability of his Counſel confirmed by an oath. That by two immutable things, in which it was impoſſible for God to ly, we might have ſtrong conſolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope ſet before us. Now in this Covenant before ſpoken to, you have both the promiſe and oath here ſpoken of, and here in this Covenant muſt needs be diſcovered, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutability of his Counſel, becauſe this is as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſaith, a covenant that is in all points perfect and ſure; and <hi>James,</hi> in his Epiſtle alluding to theſe New covenant bleſſings or gifts, ſaith, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very good and perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variableneſs, nor ſhadow of turning:</hi> and that he doth here ſpeak of the New covenant gifts, doth appear in the next words he ſaith. <hi>Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we ſhould be a kind of first fruits of his Creatures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now conſider well, that in this covenant there is nothing that he requires, but he ingageth himſelf to enable us to accompliſh. If he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:42909:30"/>
to pray, he promiſeth to give his Spirit to help our infirmities. If he command to walk in all his waies, as you have heard, he promiſeth that he will put his Spirit in them to cauſe them to walk in his waies.</p>
            <p>But ſome may object and ſay, <hi>That we find the Goſpel is held out upon Condition of Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> It is true,<note place="margin">Why though the Covenant of Grace be abſolute, yet the promiſes are held forth under a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> the promiſe of ſalvation and remiſſion of Sin, is held out with a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the world; becauſe it is Gods free mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to work that condition in the hearts of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, by means of preaching and tendering of the Goſpel, and in them only.</p>
            <p>But we are not to think, that this grace of Faith and Repentance, are any Qualifications that perſons are to attain by their own abilities unto which the Goſpel is tendred.</p>
            <p>But in the new covenant, the Lord under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to work the condition, and to give the ſalvation tendred upon that condition alſo, for ſaith he, <hi>I will be unto you a God, and you ſhall be unto me a people;</hi> and in particular, he ſaith, He <hi>will put his Law in their hearts, and in their minds will he write them, and he will teach them to know him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now doubtleſs, the Law of Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance are here included, according to thoſe Scriptures, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.8. <hi>For by grace are you ſaved through Faith, and that not of your ſelves,</hi> It is the gift of God.</p>
            <p>Where he holds forth, that though Faith be an Inſtrumental means of our ſalvation, yet

it is Gods free gift wrought in us,<note place="margin">Faith the gift of God.</note> &amp; therfore ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a covenant gift. <hi>Paul</hi> upon this ground in <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.28. ſaith, It is not only given us to believe, but to ſuffer for his names ſake where to believe, it is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of God, and ſo in <hi>Acts</hi> 18.27. ſpeaking of <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,</hi> ſaith, that when he came, he helped them much who had believed through grace, as in <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12.2. where Jeſus is ſaid to be as well the Author as the finiſher of our faith.</p>
            <p>All which paſſages do ſhew, that Faith is as well given in the new covenant, as the Salvation tendred upon that condition.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Repentance the gift of God.</note>And ſo is alſo repentance, a New covenant gift, as well as remiſſion of ſins tendred upon that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as you find in <hi>Acts</hi> 5.31. <hi>Him hath God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted with his own right hand to be a Prince and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, to give Repentance to</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and Remiſſion of ſins:</hi> and in <hi>Acts</hi> 11.18. <hi>When they heard thoſe things they held their peace and glorifyed God, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then hath God alſo to the Gentiles granted Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance unto life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where obſerve, to Gods <hi>Iſrael,</hi> both of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> God doth grant and freely give Repentance as well as ſalvation and remiſſion of ſins, promiſed upon the condition of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as likewiſe appears in the 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.25. where the Miniſters of God are commanded in meekneſs to inſtruct thoſe that oppoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, if God peradventure will at any time, give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth, which doth plainly prove, that though Repentance and Faith be the condition that the

Goſpel is tendred on, yet you ſee, the Lord doth in the New covenant, give faith and repentance as well as Remiſſion of ſins, and eternal life.</p>

            <p>That God would put or infuſe in the ſeed of the woman his created gifts of holyneſs and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and that precious love of God, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it muſt needs be, that this new nature would

               <note place="margin">The New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant not intailed upon any fleſhly line.</note>This new covenant was never intailed upon any fleſhly line or generation, as the covenant of circumciſion was, but was ſtill confirmed of God in Chriſt, and to ſuch ſouls only in Chriſt, as you find in the promiſe to <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 12.3. <hi>In thee ſhall all the Nations of the earth be bleſſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where you may obſerve, That here is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of perſons in the matter of theſe bleſſings to everlaſting life; But all Nations in Chriſt, as well one Nation as another, if in Chriſt,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:42909:32"/>
have thoſe bleſſings promiſed to them, and thus much is imployed in that promiſe, that all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons out of him are accurſed.</p>
            <p>But God here directs his ſpeech to <hi>Abraham</hi> (ſome may ſay) it is true,<note place="margin">What's meant by the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> and his ſeed.</note> but with reſpect to Chriſt now, who as touching the fleſh, was in his loins; and this bleſſedneſs or juſtification of life, which was confirmed in <hi>Abraham</hi> as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all Nations, is by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Goſpel, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.8. The Scripture foreſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that God would juſtify the Heathen through Faith, preached the Goſpel to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as it is written, <hi>In thee ſhall all the Nations of the Earth be bleſſed:</hi> ſo this bleſſedneſs ſpoken of in <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.3. is expounded by <hi>Paul,</hi> to be juſtification by faith in Chriſt, and in <hi>Acts</hi> 3. this bleſſedneſs is there expounded to be a turning of every one of them from their iniquities, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.26.</p>
            <p>And alſo this Goſpel promiſe or covenant is ſpoken to in <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.5. where he bids <hi>Abraham</hi> look up to the Heavens, and if he could number the Stars of Heaven, and the Sands upon the Sea-ſhore, ſo ſhall thy ſeed be; and <hi>Abraham</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved God, and it was accounted to him for righteouſneſs, This promiſe is quoted by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> as the Goſpel covenant in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.3. in oppoſition to the covenant of Circumciſion, intailed upon the fleſh or fleſhly line of <hi>Abraham.</hi> For Circumciſion was a Covenant in the fleſh as the Apoſtle calls it, which he alſo expounds in the 1. and 2. v. to be a Covenant of works; but more of that hereafter, only that which I would
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:42909:33"/>
obſerve at preſent is, that the Apoſtle confirms that Goſpel promiſe in <hi>Geneſis</hi> 12. and verſe 3. and <hi>Geneſis</hi> 15. and ver. 5. to be the new cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, wherein was given, through faith, the Juſtification of Life, excluding in this point the covenant of Circumciſion, called Works, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.1, 2. and both theſe covenants are made with <hi>Abraham</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. there you find the new covenant made with him, to verſe the 6. and from the 7. verſe to the 14. the covenant of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion in the fleſh; the new covenant is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the third verſe, where he ſaith, As for me my covenant ſhall be with thee, and thou ſhalt be a Father of many nations, or of a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of nations, and thy name ſhall be no more called <hi>Abram</hi> but <hi>Abraham,</hi> for a Father of a multitude of nations have I made thee, this is by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.17, 18. held out to be the Covenant of life, which he doth clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hold diſtinct and different from the covenant of Circumciſion in that place, denying that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> or his ſpiritual ſeed, had their juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the covenant of Circumciſion, but brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging in this, that <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould be a Father of many nations, and ſo ſhall thy ſeed be, as that in which <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſpiritual ſeed, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles</hi> were and ſhould be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified.</p>
            <p>And this promiſe or covenant, is made with <hi>Abraham</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.18. In thee ſhall all the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Earth be bleſſed; So long as Chriſt was according to the fleſh in <hi>Abrahams</hi> loyns,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:42909:33"/>
the promiſe runs thus, In thee, meaning that through Chriſt, which then was in him, ſhould all nations of the earth be bleſſed.</p>
            <p>But aſſoon as <hi>Iſaac</hi> was come out of <hi>Abrahams</hi> loins, as in <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.18. then ſaith he, In thy ſeed ſhall all the nations of the Earth be bleſſed: whereby ſeed, moſt ſtrictly is to be underſtood Chriſt, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> intimates in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. where he expounds this word ſeed, to be not ſeeds, as of many, but ſeed as of one, which is Chriſt. So this bleſſedneſs in the ſeed Chriſt, is here expounded to be, Gods confirming his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant in Chriſt, and note that this bleſſedneſs which <hi>David</hi> holds out to be the Covenant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed of God in Chriſt, it was not entailed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the fleſh of <hi>Abraham</hi> and his fleſhly ſeed, but made in <hi>Abraham</hi> as a Father of all the ſpiritual ſeed in all nations, and confirmed in the ſeed Chriſt, to all nations</p>
            <p>Here the Jews after the fleſh have no more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt than any other nation, except it be by faith, for faith only unites to this ſeed, and gives an in-being in the ſame.</p>
            <p>This bleſſedneſs is expounded by <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 32. laſt ver. To ly in remiſſion of ſins, and purgation of the heart from guile, and expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Apoſtle in <hi>Acts</hi> 3. laſt ver. To be a turning every one from his iniquities; for ſo there <hi>Peter</hi> expounds this bleſſedneſs, confirmed in <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed. And though Chriſt did fulfill this covenant to the Elect of the Jews, yet the reſt were hardned, and were never in
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:42909:34"/>
this ſenſe bleſt, either in the point of Juſtification or purgation from ſin, becauſe they were never in Chriſt the true ſeed by faith, nor never were thereby the ſpiritual ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> walking in the ſteps of his faith, as all his ſpiritual ſeed did, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.12. and <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.29. <hi>If you be in Chriſt, then are you</hi> Abrahams <hi>ſeed, and heirs according to the promiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I have given you from clear light of Scripture, that there were two covenants, a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, and a covenant of Works; the covenant of Grace belonging to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſpiritual ſeed in Chriſt, and all along from <hi>Adam,</hi> to all the ſpiritual ſeed of the Woman, that were born of promiſe, as the Apoſtle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes the ſpiritual ſeed, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.8. for he ſaith, ſuch are accounted the ſeed, that are ſo born of promiſe. And ſo at this day, all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons both Jews and Gentiles that are born again they are the ſeed and children, that only have an Intereſt in the promiſe of ſalvation. And ſo much for this firſt head.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Circumciſion proved to be no covenant of eternal Life, but a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal covenant.</note>Now I come in the next place to prove, that the covenant of Circumciſion is no covenant of eternal life, but a typical covenant, yea a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works, which is alſo called by the Lord a Covenant in the fleſh, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.13. and therefore to be ſure no covenant of eternal life.</p>
            <p>But for the better clearing of the truth of this I ſhall firſt expound ſome words in the covenant,<note place="margin">How the word Eve laſting is taken in the Law.</note> and that is the word <hi>Everlasting Covenant,</hi> that word ſeems to ſome to hold it forth, a covenant
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:42909:34"/>
of life, becauſe it is ſaid to be everlaſting, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the word everlaſting uſed in this Covenant, is to be underſtood only, for the <hi>Ever</hi> of the Law for the time of the Jewiſh State, as alwaies the word is to be underſtood, when applyed to the <hi>Jews</hi> in their generation. As for example, In the 16. of <hi>Leviticus</hi> it is ſaid, the Prieſt ſhould make an attonement for the holy Sanctuary, an attonement for the Tabernacle of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and for the Altar, and he ſhall make an attonement for the Prieſts, and for all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Congregation, and this ſhall be an everlaſting Statute to you to make an attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for all their ſins, once a year: which everlaſting here muſt needs be underſtood but till Chriſt came, and ſo in <hi>Numb.</hi> 25.13. <hi>He ſhall have it, and his ſeed after him, even the Covenant of an Everlaſting Prieſthood, becauſe he was zealous for his God, and made an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement for the Children of Iſrael,</hi> ſpeaking here only of a Ceremonial Prieſthood, typing out Jeſus Chriſt, the ſubſtance that was to put an end to it.</p>
            <p>And ſo this covenant of Circumciſion is to be underſtood, as everlaſting as <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the poſſeſſion thereof, which was until Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, who was the ſubſtance thereof; this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Maxim, That whereſoever the word <hi>Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting</hi> or <hi>Ever</hi> hath this joined with it, <hi>to you,</hi> or <hi>to your ſeed in their generations;</hi> that then it is to be underſtood only, for the <hi>Ever</hi> of the Law; and the time and period of that Miniſtration,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:42909:35"/>
till Chriſt come, and no longer, <hi>Exod.</hi> 40.15. <hi>Thou ſhalt annoint them, as thou didst annoint their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that they may minister unto me in the Prieſts office; for their annointing ſhall ſurely be an everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting Prieſthood throughout their generations.</hi> And ſo you have it in <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.20, 21. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaying, <hi>When they go into the Tabernacle of the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they ſhall waſh with water, that they dy not; and when they come near the altar to minister, to burn of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings made by fire unto the Lord, ſo they ſhall wash their hands and their feet, that they dy not; and it ſhall be a Statute for ever to them, even to him, and to his ſeed throughout their generations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next word that I would ſpeak to, is <hi>I will be to thee a God, and to thy ſeed after thee,</hi> which to ſome ſeems to hold forth a covenant of grace, in that he gives himſelf as a God in this covenant.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, That God either gives and makes himſelf over in a covenant of works, which is upon a condition of works done in the creature; or elſe he gives himſelf in an abſolute covenant of grace in Chriſt Jeſus the Mediator without all condition of works to be fulfilled in the creature.</p>
            <p>I ſhall make it clear, That God no otherwiſe gives himſelf in the covenant of Circumciſion but conditionally,<note place="margin">1. Argument to prove Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion a covenant of Works.</note> which is the firſt argument that I ſhall uſe to prove the covenant of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion to be a covenant of works &amp; not a covenant of eternal life, becauſe it is conditional, what God promiſeth to be or to give to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his fleſhly ſeed in their generations; it was upon a
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:42909:35"/>
condition; that <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed ſhould keep his covenant on their parties as clearly appears, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7, 8, to verſe 14. where you find the Lord engageth himſelf to <hi>Abrahamn,</hi> and his fleſhly ſeed to be their God and to give them the whole Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> In that ſenſe he would be their God, to poſſeſs them of that good land, and all the bleſſings of the ſame, upon condition, that they ſhould keep his covenant on their part, both he and his generation after him.</p>
            <p>And the ſubject matter of the covenant that they ſhould keep, is, That he ſhould be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, and circumciſe all born in his houſe and bought with money. But though Circumciſion only be here mentioned, yet all the works of the Law, at that time made known to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> are there included; as the Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds it, who beſt underſtood that Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.25. For Circumciſion verily profiteth, if thou keep the Law; but if thou be a breaker of the Law, thy circumciſion, ſhall be made uncircumciſion, and ſo you have it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.1, 2, 3. <hi>Stand faſt,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>in the Liberty where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Christ hath made you free, and be not intangled again with the yoke of bondage,</hi> which in <hi>Acts</hi> 15. it is ſaid, <hi>Neither they, nor their Fathers were able to bear;</hi> but verſe 2. <hi>Behold I Paul ſay unto you, That if you be circumciſed, Christ ſhall profit you nothing, for I testify again to every man that is circumciſed, that he is a Debtor to do the whole Law.</hi> And ſo much is clearly held forth in <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.12, 13. Where ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>As many as deſire to make a fair ſhew
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:42909:36"/>
in the fleſh, they conſtrain you to be circumciſed, only least they ſhould ſuffer perſecution for the Croſs of Christ; for neither they themſelves who are circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, keep the Law, but deſire you to be circumciſed, that they may glory in your fleſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where you may obſerve, That for men to be circumciſed themſelves, and not to keep the Law, or otherwiſe to preſs it upon others; the Apoſtle holds it to be abſurd, if withall they did not keep the Law that were thus circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
            <p>And in the Text before quoted, it is clear, That Circumciſion (in the nature of it) binds them over to keep the Law; And to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you find in <hi>Acts</hi> 15. <hi>There were certain Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers that taught the Brethren, That except they were circumciſed they could not be ſaved;</hi> Upon which the Apoſtles come together, and in the 10. verſe <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>Why tempt you God to lay a yoke upon the Diſciples necks, which neither our Fathers, nor we are able to bear?</hi> And what was this yoke, but that they were to be circumciſed and to keep the Law?</p>
            <p>So that Circumciſion was that which did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend under it the covenant of works; or the yoke of bondage that <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.1, 2, 3. bids Chriſtians ſtand faſt in their liberty or free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from that covenant or yoke of bondage which Jeſus Chriſt had freed them from.</p>
            <p>So that you may ſee that all the obſervation of the Law, which we are ſet at liberty from by Chriſt Jeſus his death, was included in the Law
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:42909:36"/>
of Circumciſion. So that in effect, here you have the covenant; <hi>Abraham</hi> (as if God ſhould ſay) I will be a God to thee, and to thy ſeed after thee in their generations, to protect, defend, and deliver thee, to bleſs thee and thy ſeed with the bleſſing of <hi>Canaan,</hi> to bleſs thee, and the fruit of thy womb, in the Basket, and in their ſtore, in all their outward bleſſings; upon condition that thou and they will be circumciſed and keep the Law. Thus God makes a covenant upon condition, So that if they fail on their part, then he is left at liberty to fail on his part, as that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table expreſſion in <hi>Jer.</hi> 11.2 3, 4, 5. <hi>Hear the word of this Covenant, and ſpeak unto the men of</hi> Judah, <hi>to the Inhabitants of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and ſay thou un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, Thus ſaith the Lord God of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>Curſed be the man that obeyeth not the words of this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which I commanded unto your Fathers, when I brought them from the Land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>from the Iron Fornace, ſaying, Obey my voice and do accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to all theſe things which I command you, ſo ſhall ye be my people, and I will be your God, that I might confirm the Oath that I have ſworn unto your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to give them a Land which floweth with Milk and Honey, as appeareth this day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whence you may clearly obſerve, That God gives himſelf to be their God, and the bleſſing of <hi>Canaan,</hi> upon condition that they would keep the Law, <hi>So ſhall ye be my people, and I will be your God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now you muſt mind, that <hi>Abraham</hi> had a new covenant of life made with him when he was
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:42909:37"/>
75. years old, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.4. which was 24. years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this time, that he had the covenant of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, and his happineſs with all his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſeed, was and is in that abſolute covenant, confirmed of God in Chriſt, which ſtands in force ſtill to believers in all Nations. But this covenant of Circumciſion was conditional, and not abſolute, therefore no covenant of life, but a covenant of works.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2. Argument to prove Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion a Covenant of works.</note>The ſecond ground why the covenant of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion muſt needs be a covenant of Works, a Typical covenant, is, becauſe it was a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal covenant, a covenant in the fleſh, as in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.13. <hi>He that is born in thy houſe, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumciſed, ſo my covenant ſhall be in your fleſh for an everlaſting Covenant.</hi> To be ſure ſuch is not the covenant of grace, to eternal life, for that was confirmed of God in Chriſt, as you hear, to all Nations; In <hi>thee ſhall all the Nations of the Earth be bleſſed, Gen.</hi> 12.3. and <hi>in thy ſeed ſhall all the Nations of the Earth be bleſſed, Gen.</hi> 22.18. as I have formerly ſpoken to.</p>
            <p>But the Lord ſaith of this Covenant of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, that it ſhall be in their fleſh for an everlaſting covenant. It is manifeſt by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> that this is therefore a covenant of Works, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.1, 2 ſaith he, <hi>What ſhall we ſay then, that Abraham our Father as appertaining to the flesh hath found? for if</hi> Abraham <hi>was juſtified by works, he hath whereof to glory, but not before God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe words are inſerted by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:42909:37"/>
for the prevention of an objection that might juſtly be in the mind of the <hi>Romans</hi> occaſioned by the Apoſtles former anſwer. For though the Apoſtle had granted in the beginning of the third chapter, that the circumciſed Jews, were in ſome reſpect privileged above other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and that chiefly, in thoſe eminent ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and offers that the Goſpel held out amongſt them; which though it proved not effectual to all, yet he minds to ſome it was effectual; But yet after in verſe 9. The Apoſtle begins to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt his underſtanding, that to be a Jew after the fleſh, and to be in the covenant of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, did not free men from the guilt of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, no more than other men that were Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, that were not Jews after the fleſh, neither circumciſed.</p>
            <p>To this purpoſe he ſtates a queſtion, What then? Are we better than they? No in no wiſe. For we have before proved, that both <hi>Jew</hi> and Gentile, are all under ſin, as it is written, there is none righteous, no not one; where the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle goes on to prove, That the Jews after the fleſh (in the covenant of Circumciſion) were equally in a damnable and ſinful condition with the poor Heatheniſh Infidels, all equally guilty before God, <hi>verſe</hi> 19. and his inference is in <hi>verſe</hi> 20. that therefore by the works of the Law, no fleſh ſhould be juſtified in his ſight, cleerly holding forth, That to be a Jew, and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, and to be under the Law, is the ſelf-ſame thing, and when the Apoſtle had concluded that
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:42909:38"/>
being a <hi>Jew</hi> in the Covenant of Circumciſion, did in no way difference him from the Heathen, as to life, He now ſhews what way both <hi>Jews</hi> and Gentiles come to the Juſtification of life, and that is freely by Gods grace through the redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption that is in Chriſt Jeſus, whom God hath ſet forth to be a propitiation, through faith in his blood, and therefore he excludes the Law of Works, wholly in the matter of Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and brings in the Law of faith; ſhewing clearly that he hath but one way to juſtify both <hi>Jew</hi> and Gentile, which is by Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, the true promiſed ſeed in the new co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe words the <hi>Romans</hi> ſeemed thus to argue, chap. 4. ver. 1. Is it ſo? that a man may be a <hi>Jew,</hi> and have intereſt in the covenant of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion entailed upon the fleſhly line, and ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and yet be not better than Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans or Heathens, as to the matter of life? What ſhall we then ſay, that <hi>Abraham</hi> our Father, as appertaining to the fleſh, hath found? As if they ſhould ſay; if a man may be a <hi>Jew</hi> of the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſo of the covenant of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and as to the matter of Juſtification and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life, be no nearer than a profane Gentile, that is not <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, nor hath any Intereſt in the Covenant? what privilege doth <hi>Abraham</hi> find in the covenant appertaining to, or intailed on the fleſh?</p>
            <p>Unto which the Apoſtle anſwers, in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and third verſes, and ſo along in the chap.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:42909:38"/>
4. of the <hi>Romans,</hi> clearly diſtinguiſhing two covenants the one of Circumciſion a covenant of works; the other a promiſe of Jeſus Chriſt, made to the faith of ſuch as believe. Therefore ſaith the Apoſtle in the 2. <hi>ver.</hi> and ſo forward; If <hi>Abraham</hi> were juſtified by works, he hath wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to glory, but not before God; plainly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting that the covenant that our Father <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> had intereſt in, as appertaining to the fleſh of him and his ſeed after him in their generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, was a covenant of works; in which <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> had nothing to glory in before God, the reaſon is given becauſe he was juſtified before God in another Covenant or promiſe <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.5, 6 For what ſaith the Scripture? <hi>Abraham</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved God, and it was accompted to him for righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>And thus the Apoſtle goes along, ſhewing that Juſtification was not to be had in the Covenant of works intailed on the fleſh of <hi>Abraham.</hi> But by faith in the Covenant of grace the promiſed ſeed, which he proves by <hi>Davids</hi> Teſtimony in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 32.1, 2. ſet down in the 6, 7, 8, <hi>verſes</hi> of this chapter.</p>
            <p>Now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hus much being ſaid, he ſtates the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, Whether this grace of Juſtification came upon the Circumciſion only, or the uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion alſo, for we ſay, that faith was reckoned unto <hi>Abraham</hi> for righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>Now here is the queſtion, ſeeing that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> had two covenants made with him, one the Goſpel of Faith, and the other a Covenant in
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:42909:39"/>
the Fleſh? In which of theſe had he his juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to eternal life?</p>
            <p>The anſwer is plain, for ſaith the Apoſtle, not in circumciſion, he was not juſtified in or by the Covenant of Circumciſion, but in the promiſe of the promiſed ſeed, which God is ſaid to give a covenant for his people by faith in that ſeed, even in uncircumciſion was <hi>Abraham</hi> juſtified, and that (as I ſaid before) 24. years before the covenant of Circumciſion was made with him, he was juſtified, believing in the promiſe of the Meſſiah, that was to come out of his loins, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fleſh, <hi>In whom all Nations of the Earth ſhould be bleſſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now God promiſing that the Meſſiah accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the fleſh, ſhould come out of <hi>Abraham, viz.</hi> out of his Loins or his fleſh, and this was then a great article of his faith, that he was to believe to righteouſneſs: not only that Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was to be had, and bleſſedneſs to be had? But it muſt be had in that ſeed, that was to come out of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the fleſh.</p>
            <p>And as a confirmation and ſeal of this pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique righteouſneſs, confirmed in <hi>Abraham</hi> as a Father of all Nations, God elects that fleſh and blood to himſelf, I mean the family of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> in an external Covenant, to point out to all the world, that as verily as God did take this nation (according to the fleſh) to himſelf by this external covenant, ſo would God be incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in this fleſh.</p>
            <p>And as the fleſh of the fore-ſkin of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:42909:39"/>
of Generation muſt be cut or bruiſed, and the blood ſhed, by which the <hi>Jew</hi> according to the fleſh, was bound to keep the Law, this I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand did figure out, how Chriſt the true ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> deſcending out of his loins by Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, ſhould (conſidered as male and not fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male) by breaking his fleſh, and ſhedding his blood, fulfil and ſatisfy the Law.</p>
            <p>So that this Covenant of Circumciſion, was of ſealing uſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to confirm this other covenant, and a School-Maſter to lead to Chriſt, as all other Branches of that old covenant were: Therefore ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. Moreover he received the ſign of Circumciſion, a ſeal of the Righteouſneſs of faith, which he had, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed, that he might be the father of all thoſe that believe.</p>
            <p>Where obſerve, the Apoſtle calls not cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion a ſeal, but a ſign, <hi>He received the ſign of Circumciſion, a ſeal of the righteouſneſs of faith which he had being uncircumciſed.</hi> There are theſe reaſons in the Text that reſtrain the ſealing uſe of Circumciſion only to <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The ſealing uſe of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion proved to be peculiar unto <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe this righteouſneſs of faith, the Text ſaith, he had before he was circumciſed. Therefore good reaſon it might be ſealed or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, having it before he received the ſign of Circumciſion, a ſeal of the righteouſneſs of faith which he had being uncircumciſed. But his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity after him, at eight daies old cannot be ſaid that they had this righteouſneſs of faith to ſeal, having it not preceding their Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:42909:40"/>The ſecond reaſon the text affords us, is, that he might be the Father of all that believe, this is the main reaſon the Apoſtle inſiſts upon, <hi>He received the ſign of Circumciſion, a ſeal of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of faith, that he might be the Father of all that believe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This reaſon cannot be applyable to any of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> poſterity, beſides himſelf, for they were not the Fathers of all that believe, That was proper to <hi>Abraham</hi> to be a high Father, or a Father of all nations; therefore (as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) God promiſing in <hi>Abraham</hi> that publique righteouſneſs, as a father of all Nations in the the covenant of grace, adds to that covenant an external covenant, to be intailed in his line, and in his fleſh, as a confirmation of the ſame.</p>
            <p>A third reaſon is this, Here is the Spirit of God affirming the ſealing uſe of Circumciſion to <hi>Abraham</hi> only, and not to any one of his fleſhly ſeed, and as before, upon a reaſon ſpecial to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham;</hi> Now where the Scripture hath not a Mouth to ſpeak, we muſt not have an Ear to hear. But the Scripture here only affirms Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, to be a Seal of the righteouſneſs of faith to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and affords no ſuch thing as to his ſeed.</p>
            <p>A fourth reaſon lies in verſe 13. That the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of <hi>Abraham</hi> to be the heir of the world, was not to him, nor his ſeed through the Law, that is, through the covenant of Circumciſion, but through the righteouſneſs of faith.</p>
            <p>For if they which are of the Law, be heirs,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:42909:40"/>
then faith is made void, and the promiſe of none effect, becauſe the Law worketh wrath, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is of faith, that it might be by Grace to the end the promiſes might be ſure to all the ſeed. Not to that only which is of the Law, but to that alſo which is of the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who is the father of us all, as it is written, <hi>I have made thee a father of many Nations, before him who belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, even God, who quickneth the dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that there is not in all the Scripture, a place more clearly proves the covenant of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion intailed on the fleſhly line of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to be a covenant of works than this 4. of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> clearing and ſetting the covenant of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion and Faith in oppoſition, holding forth that <hi>Abraham</hi> and all his ſpiritual ſeed, had their Juſtification in another covenant, and not in the covenant of Circumciſion; clearly holding forth the covenant of Circumciſion to be works and not Grace, which doth ſufficiently prove, that the covenant of Circumciſion, had no promiſe of Juſtification or eternal life in it.</p>
            <p>But further,<note place="margin">An Appendix to the ſecond Argument to prove Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works.</note> That the covenant intailed on the fleſh, muſt needs be underſtood to be a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of works, <hi>viz.</hi> that of Circumciſion ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.2, 3, 4. and ſo forward, where ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Beware of Doggs, beware of evil Workers, beware of the Conciſion; for we are the Circumciſion, that worſhip God in the Spirit, and rejoice in Jeſus Chriſt, and put no confidence in the fleſh.</hi> By fleſh he means the covenant entailed upon the fleſh, the covenant of Circumciſion,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:42909:41"/>
it is plain by his anſwer, for he ſaith, <hi>If any man thinketh he hath whereof to truſt in the fleſh, I more, circumciſed the eighth day, of the ſtock of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>of the Tribe of</hi> Benjamen, <hi>an</hi> Hebrew <hi>of the</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews, <hi>as touching the Law, a Phariſee, concerning zeal, perſecuting the Church, touching the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Law, blameleſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this he ſets by no more, than dung or droſs, in compariſon of the other Covenant or Promiſe of Chriſt, righteouſneſs and ſalvation by him, which he received by faith, and he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the loſs of all things for the ſake of him, and did accompt all the whole privilege of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, and the covenant of works, to be but as dung, that he might win Chriſt, which if the promiſe of Chriſt, and ſalvation and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification by him, had been given in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the fleſh, and line of <hi>Abraham,</hi> then it had been very improper for <hi>Paul,</hi> to accompt this as dung, and to caſt contempt upon it, as that which was wholly void of Chriſt. It would be very ſinful for any man in ſuch a caſe, to caſt ſuch contempt upon the covenant of grace it ſelf and the privileges thereof peculiarly relating to the ſame.</p>
            <p>But you ſee, <hi>Paul</hi> doth here clearly diſtinguiſh two covenants, The one of ſaith, the other of Circumciſion. This will further appear in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Are ye ſo fooliſh, that having begun in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, are ye now made perfect in the fleſh?</hi> Where he again diſtinguiſheth two covenants, the one Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, the other a fleſhly covenant. The <hi>Galla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:42909:41"/>
having at the firſt hearing of him, begun to imbrace the Goſpel or the Spirit or Spiritual word of the New Covenant, and now they would join the covenant of works in the fleſh, with the Goſpel, which, it is evident, he means the covenant of circumciſion, which here they would ſeek to be perfected by:</p>
            <p>Therefore in <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. <hi>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tter end,</hi> he clearly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſheth between two Covenants, under the figure of <hi>Sarah</hi> and <hi>Hagar,</hi> and two ſeeds; hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding forth the covenant of Circumciſion to be the covenant of works, and to be that bond-woman (as it were) in chap. 5.1, 2, 3. <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.12, 13. So that if you will ſeriouſly mind theſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, they do moſt evidently prove, that the covenant of Circumciſion made in the fleſh or fleſhly line of <hi>Abraham,</hi> is a covenant of works, and that which the Goſpel or Covenant of grace, is ſet in oppoſition to; and as this covenant of Circumciſion is ſet in oppoſition to the covenant of eternal life: as having all the works of the Law included in it. So conſider the new cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſpeaks thus, I will put my Law in your hearts, and in your minds will I write them. But Circumciſion is a covenant, not in the heart, but in the fleſh only as you have heard; This is the ſecond ground, why the covenant of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion cannot be a covenant of eternal life, but a covenant of works only.</p>
            <p>The third reaſon to prove Circumciſion to be a Covenant of works, an not of eternal life,<note place="margin">3. Argument to prove Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion a Covenant of Works.</note> is,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:42909:42"/>Becauſe that there is no promiſe of eternal life in it, but of temporal bleſſings in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and that God promiſing himſelf to be a God, is only in that reſpect, as to outward Protection and Proviſion in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and other like privileges. And that is noted by the Apoſtle in <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.6. But now hath he obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a more excellent Miniſtery; by how much alſo he is a Mediator of a better covenant, which was eſtabliſhed upon better promiſes:</p>
            <p>Herein he clearly doth ſhew, that the covenant waxing old and vaniſhing away, was grounded upon worſe promiſes, which muſt needs be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood temporal promiſes, as in <hi>Jerem.</hi> 11.2, 3, 4, 5. <hi>Hear ye the words of this Covenant, and ſpeak unto the men of</hi> Judah, <hi>and Inhabitants of</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, <hi>and ſay unto them, Thus ſaith the Lord God of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>Curſed be the man that obeyeth not the words of this Covenant, which I commanded your Fathers in the day that I brought them out of the land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>from the Iron Furnace, ſaying, Obey my voice and do them, according to all which I command you. So ſhall ye be my people, and I will be your God, that I may perform the Oath that I have ſworn unto your Fathers, to give them a Land flowing with milk and honey, as it is this day; then anſwered I and ſaid, So be it O Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where you have this Covenant of Gods being his peoples God, and giving them <hi>Canaan,</hi> annexed to the works of the Law as being all one covenant.</p>
            <p>Obſerve the words in the Text, <hi>So ſhall ye be

my people, and I will be your God, that I may perform the Covenant which I have ſworn to your Fathers to give them a Land flowing with Milk and Honey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You ſhall ſee that the promiſes of <hi>Canaan</hi> and the bleſſings thereof, are annexed to the Law of works, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.15. <hi>See, I have ſet before thee life and good, and death and evil, In that I command thee this day, to love the Lord thy God, to walk in his waies, and to keep his commandments and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, and his Judgements, that thou mayst live and multiply, and the Lord thy God ſhall bleſs thee in the Land whither thou goest to poſſeſs it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo in the laſt verſe, where he preſſeth the people to obey his voice, that they might dwell in the Land, that the Lord ſware unto their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> to give them. And ſo in <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.12, 13. <hi>Wherefore it ſhall come to paſs, that if you hearken to thoſe Judgements to keep and do them, that then the Lord ſhall keep unto thee the covenant and the mercy that he ſware to thy Fathers; and he will love thee and bleſs thee, and multiply thee, he will alſo bleſs thee in the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy Land, thy Corn, and thy Wine, and thine Oyl, the increaſe of thy Kine, and the flock of thy Sheep in the Land which he ſware unto thy Fathers to give thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that you ſee, the covenant of God, giving himſelf a God, to the National people of the <hi>Jews</hi> in relation to the bleſſing of <hi>Canaan,</hi> was ſtill upon obedience to the works of the Law; that this covenant which God elected to himſelf the body of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in, and by which he ſeperated
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:42909:43"/>
them to himſelf from all the Nations of the Earth, it is clear, was a covenant of works; wherein the people were bound to outward ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance, and worſhip, and ſervice to God. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Condition would God be their God, and give them <hi>Canaan.</hi> For there is a vaſt difference, in Gods making over himſelf to be a God to a People, in a conditional covenant of Works out of Chriſt, and in an abſolute covenant eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed of God in Chriſt. For in ſuch a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant he was never the God of the whole family of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or Church of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> the elect obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that, the reſt were hardned, as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.17.</p>

               <note place="margin">4. Argument to prove Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion a Covenant of Works.</note>The fourth ground is this, That a man by laying out a little money, might have brought a Perſon into this Covenant, and intereſſed him thereby into all the Privileges of the ſame; which if this were a covenant of life, wherein the Spirit and Spiritual gifts of the Lord had been given, a man might ſay as <hi>Peter</hi> did ſay to <hi>Symon Magus, Thy money periſh with thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But for that reaſon, moſt certain it is, That this covenant of Circumciſion is no ſpiritual co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, which will appear from the words of the Covenant in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.12, 13. <hi>And he that is eight daies old, ſhall be circumciſed among you, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man child in your Generations, he that is born in the houſe, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy ſeed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He that is born in thy houſe, and he that is bought with thy money, muſt needs be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, and my covenant ſhall be in your fleſh, for an everlaſting covenant.</p>

               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:42909:43"/>Where obſerve, That all bought with money muſt be circumciſed, ſo that if an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> ſhould buy a black <hi>Moor,</hi> or the moſt ſavage Heathen in the World; he was bound to ſee him circumciſed, and being circumciſed he was now in that cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. The truth is, Circumciſion was one of thoſe carnal Ordinances, that the Author to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.9. doth ſpeak of that was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted till the time of Reformation.</p>
            <p>Now the perſon which the Lord would have circumciſed, muſt be of the family of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and that is all the qualifications required: For God doth not require a perſon, ſo and ſo ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually qualified, as he doth now under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; the Lord gives in general a Law and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> That all his Family muſt be circumciſed, and that he muſt ſee it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
            <p>It is not in the inſtitution enjoined, that the perſon that doth circumciſe muſt be a believer, neither is it enjoined that the perſon upon whom it is done, muſt have Diſciple-ſhip, or the work of grace, but this only, He muſt be one of the Family of <hi>Abraham,</hi> either born in his houſe, or bought with his money; and ſo the ſlave bought with money, was as truly intereſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed into the covenant of God, and the right of eating the Paſſeover, as one born in the houſe of the ſeed of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A fifth ground is this,<note place="margin">5. Argument to prove Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion a Covenant of Works.</note> That men (out of this Covenant) might be ſaved, and ſuch as were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally intereſſed in it, might be damned.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:42909:44"/>As for Example, <hi>Lot</hi> dwelling in the City of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and all the Godly that day in the whole world, excepting <hi>Abraham</hi> and his houſe, or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, were no way intereſſed in the Covenant of Circumciſion, yet were ſaved.

And it is plain that neither they, nor any of their children or families, had right to Circumciſion, and the bleſſing of <hi>Canaan;</hi> but moſt ſure it is, they had intereſt in the Covenant of life, which plainly ſhews that Circumciſion was but an earthly typical covenant, ſuch as good and godly men might nor have intereſt in, and ſuch as wicked men had an intereſt in.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:42909:44"/>Do not we find, That all <hi>Davids</hi> ſons were in this covenant? but how many except <hi>Solomon,</hi> had any right to the covenant of life, yea <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf had eight Sons, and each of them a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, but there was none of the other had the covenant of Circumciſion made with them, but only <hi>Iſaac,</hi> though the reſt were as truly the Sons of believing <hi>Abraham</hi> as <hi>Iſaac</hi> was; for <hi>Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael,</hi> and the ſix Sons that he had by <hi>Keturah</hi> with their generations, were all the children of the ſame believing <hi>Abraham</hi> as <hi>Iſaac</hi> was, and yet this covenant, ran not upon either of their Poſterity, but in <hi>Iſaac,</hi> ſaith the Text, ſhall thy ſeed be called; though we may not be ſo uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable but to think that many of the ſeed of thoſe that went into the Eaſt Countrey, might be the elect of God, and in a covenant of Grace, yet be ſure, they had not an Intereſt in this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Circumciſion, and the Inheritance of <hi>Canaan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Iſaiah</hi> tells us, in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> chapter 1. verſe 9. That if God had not left him a very ſmall Remnant, <hi>Iſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>So that there was in the whole Nation of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> (that were in the covenant of Circumciſion) but a very ſmall Remnant ſelected out from the reſt, into the covenant of life, as in <hi>Romans</hi> 9. the Apoſtle ſo makes uſe of the words, and in the <hi>Romans</hi> chap. 11. ver. 5, 7. the Apoſtle ſaith, the election in and amongſt <hi>Iſrael</hi> have obtained it, and the reſt were hardned or blinded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:42909:45"/>The reſt (may ſome ſay) what reſt? the reſt of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the covenant of Circumciſion. But it is plain, that all Iſrael were elected, one as much as another in the Covenant of Circumciſion, by which they were, as I have ſaid, ſeperated to God from all other nations.</p>
            <p>But it is plain, That there was a Goſpel Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment confirmed of God in Chriſt, held out and tendred to the Jews by the Holy Prophets and Pen-men of God, the election obtained that, and the reſt were hardned, remaining ſtill in the literal and old Covenant of Circumciſion which they had only right to by generation.</p>
            <p>But this none could have right to, but by the regeneration and new birth, and therefore ſaith <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 8.28. <hi>I and the children that thou haſt given me, are as ſigns and wonders in</hi> Iſrael, implying clearly, that a little handful of <hi>Iſrael</hi> are given to Chriſt, in the Covenant of grace, out from amongſt the body of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the reſt of the multitude of <hi>Iſrael</hi> remained without being given to Chriſt, making ſigns and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders at ſuch as were given to him, by being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into a covenant of eternal life through faith, which it appears, the whole body of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> were not admitted into, but ſome few only. So that you ſee Souls may be in this covenant of Circumciſion, and be damned; and out of it, and ſaved; therefore this cannot be a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of eternal life, but only a Typical cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works:</p>
            <p>The ſixth ground to prove that the Covenant
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:42909:45"/>
of Circumciſion, was but a covenant of Works,<note place="margin">6. Argument to prove Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion a Covenant of Works.</note> an outward Typical Covenant, was this.</p>
            <p>That this Covenant of Circumciſion might be broken, as the Lord ſaith in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.14. And the uncircumciſed man-child, whoſe fleſh of his foreſkin is not circumciſed, that ſoul ſhall be cut off from my people, he hath broken my covenant.</p>
            <p>Where obſerve, though he were born of the Family, and of the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſo had an intereſt in the Covenant; yet he might forfeit his right, and break this covenant, ſo as to be caſt off from Gods people.</p>
            <p>This is therefore that old Covenant ſpoke of by <hi>Jeremy</hi> chap. 31. ver. 31. <hi>I will make a new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with the houſe of Iſrael, not like that Covenant which I made with their Fathers, which they broke, and my ſoul had no pleaſure in them.</hi> For as I have ſhewed before, it is impoſſible that the New co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant can be broken, becauſe it is an abſolute covenant, made on no condition to be fulfilled by the creature, but the Lord works both to will and to do of his good pleaſure, in this covenant, therefore it is not in him that willeth, nor in him that runneth, but in God that ſhews mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Therefore the Lord ſpeaking of the new co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant in <hi>Jer.</hi> 33.15. and ſo forward, ſaith, <hi>In thoſe daies and at that time, I will cauſe the branch of righteouſneſs to grow up unto</hi> David, <hi>he ſhall exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute Judgement and Righteouſneſs in the Land; in thoſe daies ſhall</hi> Judah <hi>be ſaved, and</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>ſhall dwell ſafely, and this is the name wherewith
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:42909:46"/>
he ſhall be called, The Lord our righteouſneſs; for thus ſaith the Lord,</hi> David <hi>ſhall never want a man to ſit upon the Throne of the houſe of</hi> Iſrael.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Neither ſhall the Prieſt the Levite, want a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me to offer burnt offerings, and to kindle meat offerings, and to do ſacrifice continually. And the word of the Lord came to</hi> Jeremiah, <hi>ſaying, Thus ſaith the Lord, If you can break my covenant of the day, and my covenant of the night, that there ſhould not be day and night in their ſeaſons, then may alſo my cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant be broken with</hi> David <hi>my Servant, that he ſhould not have a Son to reign upon his Throne.</hi> Where you ſee the ſpiritual covenant cannot be broken, as <hi>Pſalm</hi> 89.34. <hi>My Covenant will I not break, nor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the thing that is gone out of my mouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore it muſt needs be a covenant of works, that is, conditional, he made ſuch a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with the Prieſt, mentioned in the firſt of <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.30. where the Lord ſaith to this purpoſe, <hi>Wherefore the God of</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſaid, I ſaid indeed that thy houſe and the houſe of thy Fathers, ſhould walk before me for ever. But now ſaith the Lord, be it far from me, for them that honor me, I will honor, and they that deſpiſe me, ſhall be lightly esteemed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You muſt ſtill mind thoſe promiſes the Lord makes upon condition, the creature not wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the performance of the condition on his part, God is ſet free, or at liberty, whether he will perform ſuch conditional promiſes, yea, or no.</p>
            <p>But it is not ſo in abſolute promiſes confirmed of God in Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.17. thoſe promiſes are all Yea, and Amen, as you ſee in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. But
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:42909:46"/>
the covenant of Circumciſion being a covenant of works, a poor creature truly intereſſed in that covenant, might break it, forfeit his intereſt, and be caſt out and rejected out of that covenant from amongſt his people, as is clearly confirmed in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 50.1. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord? where is the Bill of your Mothers Divorcement, which I have put away? or to which of my Creditors, have I ſold you? behold, for your iniquities have you ſold your ſelves, and for your tranſgreſſions is your Mother put away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now (beloved) a divorce argues a breach and forfeiting the covenant, which the body of all <hi>Iſrael</hi> was in; and we know all along, the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal covenant was that of Circumciſion, and they that know in the leaſt meaſure, the nature of the covenant of Grace, cannot but know it to be ſuch a covenant, out of which a ſoul can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be divorced from the Lord.</p>
            <p>But ſome may ſay, There are many that are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly in a covenant of Grace now under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and yet may be caſt out from Gods people: yet it followeth not, but that it is a covenant of Grace, and ſo then, they might be viſibly in a covenant of Grace and yet be rejected.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Perſons may now profeſs to be in Chriſt, and ſo in a covenant of Grace, by an outward profeſſion, but this being barely a profeſſion, and not in truth in them that profeſs the ſame; they profeſs they were in that, which in truth they never were: For under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, we have no infallible rule to know who is in the covenant of Grace, and who not; becauſe
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:42909:47"/>
we have only the confeſſion of themſelves, who may deceive themſelves and us.</p>
            <p>But we have an infallible Rule to judge, That <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and the ſeed forward in their Loins, or their generations, were in this covenant of Circumciſion; and therefore it is a great miſtake for any to evade what hath been ſaid upon ſuch a groundleſs objection.</p>
            <p>Now conſider, That it is that great and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful God that ſaith and profeſſeth, <hi>Abrabam,</hi> his ſeed and family after him, from <hi>Jacob</hi> forward, were in this covenant with him; But now it is only poor unfaithful Man, hypocritical, diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, proud man, that ſaith he is in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of life, when it proves not ſo, or when it viſibly proves the contrary, for Saints have a Rule to diſown ſuch. But this is a moſt certain truth, that God did never put a ſoul away, and make a divorce between himſelf and any one Soul, in a covenant of life; and it is as certain that the whole Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> were in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and truth in the covenant of Circumciſion, as appears in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.10, 11. where <hi>Abraham,</hi> and thoſe born in his houſe, are to be circumciſed. And ſo <hi>Pſalm</hi> 105.9, 10.11, which covenant he made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his oath with <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and confirmed the ſame to <hi>Jacob</hi> by a Law, and to <hi>Iſrael</hi> for an everlaſting covenant, ſaying, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto thee have I given the Land of</hi> Canaan, <hi>the Lot of your inheritance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now it would plentifully appear, (if further proof needed) That God his own ſelf teſtifyeth
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:42909:47"/>
his making and entering into covenant, with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and their ſeed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, therefore let no man pleaſe himſelf with ſuch a poor, groundleſs objection, That the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were only viſibly or in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Charity, in the covenant of Circumciſion as Hypocrites are now in the Covenant of Grace,</p>
            <p>For there is nothing more clear than this, that <hi>Iſrael</hi> were in truth and reality, in the covenant of Circumciſion, expreſſed by the Mouth of God himſelf, and nothing more certain, that <hi>Iſrael</hi> were never (all of them) ſo much viſibly in the covenant of grace.</p>
            <p>For if it were neceſſary, I could multiply places of Scripture, to prove the moſt part of <hi>Iſrael</hi> viſibly unbelievers, living in thoſe mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt fruits of the fleſh, as Drunkenneſs, Swearing, Lying, Whoring, Stealing. Covetouſneſs, and palpable Ignorance, without faith and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, ſhedding of blood. All theſe notorious ſins, were conſtantly in the greateſt part of the Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that they neighed (as fed Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes) after their Neighbours wives, and were given to oppreſſion and horrid Idolatrie. All theſe ſins being ſuch manifeſt fruits of the fleſh, that ſuch as live in them, the Apoſtle ſaith, cannot enter into the Kingdom of Chriſt and of God, but are viſibly the children of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. Therefore to ſay, the whole body of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were viſibly godly, and ſo viſibly in the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, that is a moſt groſs miſtake; they were really in the outward National cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:42909:48"/>
of Circumciſion, but not the generality ſo much as viſibly in the Goſpel covenant of life.</p>
            <p>For it could not be denyed, but that thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> in the 8. chapter of <hi>John</hi> verſe 30. and ſo forward, were <hi>Abrahams</hi> children, &amp; intereſſed in the covenant of works, yet Chriſt is far from concluding their right to the covenant of Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, the heavenly adoption, but rather in that reſpect concludeth, <hi>They are of their Father the Devil, whoſe works they did,</hi> they being Lyars as he was from the beginning, and enemies to Chriſt, as the Devil was, therefore he excludes them from being the children of God, ſo that the main maſs of blindneſs and darkneſs, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon mens minds is this, they mix and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the two covenants made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> the one a ſpiritual heavenly covenant, made to him as a Father of the faithful, and to thoſe only who walk in the ſteps of faithful <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the temporal covenant of Circumciſion to the ſeed according to the fleſh, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Jacob</hi> forward, and thoſe joining themſelves to that family.</p>
            <p>So then in a word, the covenant of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion muſt needs be a covenant of works, and not of eternal life, becauſe it might be broken, which the covenant of eternal life cannot be.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">7. Argument to prove Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion a Covenant of works.</note>The ſeventh ground to prove the covenant of Circumciſion not to be a covenant of Grace, is,</p>
            <p>That if we maintain the covenant of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, to be a covenant of Grace, to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life; therein we overthrow many funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental points of Religion, which is a ſtrong

ground to prove, it is not of Grace, but an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward typical covenant. For it is impoſſible, that ſuch underſtanding of Scripture which croſſeth plain fundamental points of religion, can be true.</p>
            <p>Now for to give you ſome example for this, Firſt you muſt needs confeſs, that the covenant of Circumciſion was made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his ſeed after him in their generations, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. from <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> forward. So that being born in the houſe or Family of Iſrael, or being bought with the money of one of the Iſraelites, intereſſed a perſon in that covenant, he coming forth of that line, was born heir to that cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and the privileges of the ſame.</p>
            <p>Now conſider,<note place="margin">To ſay that the covenant of Grace is entailed on the fleſh, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthroweth the main fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental points of our Religion.</note> That the chief and precious privileges of the covenant of grace, are adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Son-ſhip, Juſtification, and the inward work of ſanctification, all which privileges, that generation muſt needs be born heirs to, if they were born heirs of a covenant of grace, which if this ſhould be aſſerted, as it is by thoſe who defend childrens baptiſm.</p>
            <p>Then this fundamental point of <hi>Religion</hi> muſt needs be denyed, that all mankind are by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the children of wrath <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.2. and that all both Jews and Gentiles are charged under ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.9. And there is none righteous, no not one; But be it known to you, this is a fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental doctrine of truth, generally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by all the godly, That we are dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, wherein in times paſt, we walked according to the courſe of this world
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:42909:49"/>
according to the Prince of the power of the air, the ſpirit that now worketh in the children of diſobedience, among whom alſo we had our converſation in times paſt, in the luſt of the fleſh, and of the mind, and were children of wrath by nature as well as others.</p>
            <p>Now the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> affirmeth this to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually the ſtate of himſelf, who was born in the Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as well as the Gentiles; and <hi>David</hi> doth affirm this of all in general, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 14.2, 3. which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> urgeth in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.9. <hi>forwards,</hi> ſpeaking of himſelf and the reſt of the National Churches of the <hi>Jews, What are we</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>better than they?</hi> meaning than the Gentiles <hi>No, in no wiſe,</hi> for we have before proved <hi>that both</hi> Jews <hi>and Gentiles are all under ſin, as it written, there is none righteous, no not one; there is none that understandeth, there is none that ſeeketh after God, they are all gone out of the way, they are together become abominable, there is none that doth good, no not one;</hi> And in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 51. <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>I was conceived in ſin, and brought forth in iniquity;</hi> who was a child of the Church of God, as it is uſually termed.</p>
            <p>But beloved this doctrine is clear in Scripture, and clearly experienced by every Godly Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, which truth muſt needs be overthrown, if the whole body of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were born adopted Sons and heirs of a covenant of eternal life, born heirs of Juſtification, then they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heirs of wrath, nor in a ſtate of damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor never proved nor charged under ſin nor
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:42909:49"/>
never all unrighteous, becauſe born heirs of a covenant of Grace, aad of righteouſneſs, nor never born dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, for that is inconſiſtent with being in a covenant of grace and life.</p>
            <p>This opinion of holding the covenant of grace, to be intailed in the fleſh, oppoſing it ſelf ſo directly againſt this forementioned foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Religion, muſt needs be a groſs error ſo conſidered.</p>
            <p>The ſecond fundamental point of Religion, that this error oppoſeth it ſelf againſt, is ſtabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in a covenant of eternal life, it cannot be imagined, that I ſhould much inſiſt upon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this Doctrine of ſtability in grace, to be a fundamental truth, I ſhall take that for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the nature of the new covenant, in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Scriptures before recited, as in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 125. <hi>They that truſt in the Lord ſhall be as Mount</hi> Zion, <hi>which cannot be removed, but as the Mountains are round about</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>ſo ſhall the Lord be about them, from this time forth, and for ever.</hi> And in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.33. <hi>If thy children ſin, I will afflict them, with the rods of men, but my loving kindneſs will I not utterly take from them, nor ſuffer my faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to fail; My covenant will I not break, nor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the thing that is gone out of my mouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But taking this for granted to be a truth, that all born in the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> were born heirs of his ſtable Covenant; and ſo were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and in truth in the covenant of grace, then moſt of the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> that were in a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:42909:50"/>
of grace, were damned and not ſaved, as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 10.22, 23. Though <hi>Iſrael</hi> were as the ſand of the Sea, yet a Remnant of them were ſaved only. And ſo <hi>Iſaiah</hi> with <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.27, 28, 31. <hi>But</hi> Iſrael <hi>which followed after the Law of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, hath not obtained to the Law of righteouſneſs. Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.5. <hi>There was a Remnant accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the election of grace,</hi> and in verſe 7. how they obtained it, but the reſt were hardened, all but the remnant, were blinded, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened.</p>
            <p>Therefore if ſuch multitudes, as the ſand of the Sea, were all really in a covenant of grace, moſt of them muſt be underſtood to fall out of the covenant, and ſo to fall out of the covenant of life.</p>
            <p>This is another fundamental truth, that this opinion is fully againſt, defending that ſouls may be truly in a covenant of eternal life, and yet pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh and be damned.</p>
            <p>The third foundation that this error over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws, is, The neceſſity of Converſion or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, which doctrine is eminently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Chriſt in the Goſpel as a fundamental truth, <hi>John</hi> 3.4, 5. where Chriſt ſpeaking to <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chodemus,</hi> tells him, th except a man be born again of water and of the Spirit, he cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Kingdom of God. And likewiſe in <hi>John</hi> 8.24. <hi>Except ye believe that I am he, ye ſhall dy in your ſins,</hi> And <hi>John</hi> 3. <hi>two laſt verſes, He that believeth not, the wrath of God abideth on him, and he ſhall not ſee life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:42909:50"/>The before mentioned errors that holds a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of life running in the fleſh upon the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſeed oppoſeth it ſelf againſt this for might the carnal ſeed of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſay to Chriſt, why do you preach ſuch a doctrine to us, <hi>That except you be born again, you cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven?</hi> We affirm the contrary, ſeeing by the firſt birth we have an intereſt in the covenant of grace, and eternal life already, without belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and being born again, and ſo are entered into the Kingdom of God, and the privileges thereof. Whereas you ſay, That except you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that I am he, you ſhall dy in your ſins? why doth Chriſt pronounce death without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, ſeeing we are acquainted with another way to enter into life, than the way of believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is to be begotten of one of the church or a believer?</p>
            <p>We find the Holy Ghoſt in the 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. ſaith, <hi>He that hath Christ hath life, he that hath not Chriſt hath not life.</hi> No, ſaith this error, there were thouſands that were intereſſed in life, without having Chriſt, that is to ſay, by carnal generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Saith the Apoſtle, <hi>There is no other name un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der heaven by which we can be ſaved but by the name of Jeſus,</hi> Yea, ſaith this error, There is another name, by which we may come into a covenant of eternal life, and ſo to be ſaved; ſo that here lies the caſe, where Chriſt in the Goſpel power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully affirms no other way to life, but by believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, regeneration, and coming to Jeſus Chriſt; This opinion deſtroys all theſe teſtimonies, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:42909:51"/>
another door of entrance into the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of life beſides this, and that by fleſhly ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, though Chriſt ſaith to <hi>Nicodemus, Joh.</hi> 3. <hi>That which is born of the fleſh, is fleſh, and that which is born of the Spirit, is Spirit;</hi> as if ſouls were infatuated, and had no ears to hear his plain word.</p>
            <p>They of this opinion do defend the contrary, to what purpoſe ſhould any man ſeek the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of any of Believers children; whether formerly of the nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> or now the nations of the believing Gentiles; ſeeing they are born heirs of a covenant of eternal life, and ſo are in as good a ſtate without converſion and believing and being born again, as any other ſoul by believing, and by new birth can be brought into?</p>
            <p>This doctrine tends to juſtify the Rebellious <hi>Jews</hi> againſt <hi>John Baptist,</hi> and againſt Chriſt; the <hi>Sadduces</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> came to <hi>Johns</hi> Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, <hi>Matthew</hi> 3.

John</hi> you ſee, would have this people to be converted to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title them to this covenant of Grace, and ſo to baptiſm, which is an Ordinance of the ſame covenant, and not ſo much as think ſo errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, as if being children to <hi>Abraham</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the fleſh ſhould intitle them to the ſame; therefore, ſaith he, think not within
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:42909:51"/>
your ſelves, we have <hi>Abraham</hi> to our Father, and we are his children according to the fleſh, and therefore we need not a work of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or true Repentance, to intitle us to the privileges of the covenant, ſuch as was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm. And alſo in <hi>John</hi> 8.31. and forwards, ſaith Chriſt unto ſome <hi>Jews,</hi> unto whom he ſpake, <hi>If you abide in my words, then are you my Diſciples indeed, and you ſhall know the truth, and the truth ſhall make you free, and then you ſhall be free indeed.</hi> They anſwered him, <hi>We be</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams <hi>children, and never were in bondage to any, How ſayest thou then, We ſhall be made free?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where you may obſerve, theſe wicked ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate <hi>Jews</hi> were of the ſame opinion, that they were in a ſtate of happineſs, good enough by generation by being <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed according to the fleſh. Jeſus anſwereth, <hi>Who ſo commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth ſin, is the ſervant of ſin, and the Servant abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not in the houſe for ever.</hi> We find Chriſt afterwards tells theſe Sons of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that they were ſo far from being the adopted ſons of God, in a covenant of life, that they were of their Father the Devil, and theſe ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Chriſt ſpeaks to in verſe the 24. telling them, Except they believed Chriſt was he, they ſhould dy in their ſins.</p>
            <p>Chriſt was far from this opinion, as to think that covenant of Circumciſion to be a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of life, but he doth throughly reprehend them for this groundleſs confidence, which er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:42909:52"/>
was the main obſtacle, that hindered the <hi>Jews</hi> from faith and repentance, becauſe they thought it intituled them to happineſs enough to be of the ſtock of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to be born heirs of the covenant of Circumciſion; This very rotten opinion was to them one of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils ſleights to lull them aſleep in a carnal and unconverted condition they thought that need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not; which thought of theirs had been true enough, provided all the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> had by generation, intereſt in the covenant of life, which other men could have no intereſt in without regeneration; But Chriſt you ſee preſſeth a neceſſity of converſion to theſe chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Abraham</hi> that at the preſent were as fully intereſſed in the covenant of Circumciſion as <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf, even to <hi>Nicodemus</hi> which was a Ruler of the <hi>Jews,</hi> Chriſt preſſeth a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thereof to him, and alſo labours by a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in <hi>Luke</hi> 16. to convince thoſe ſottiſh <hi>Jews<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> that one might be the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the fleſh, and yet be irrecover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably damned; and therefore he brings in the rich man in Hell, ſpeaking thus, <hi>Father</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <hi>I pray thee, ſend</hi> Lazarus <hi>to dip the tip of his finger in water to cool my tongue.</hi> And <hi>Abraham</hi> is brought in, owning him to be his Son, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus, <hi>My Son remember, that thou in thy life time, receivedſt thy good things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where you may obſerve, That the man in Hell, irrecoverably damned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> owns <hi>Abraham</hi> to be his Father, and <hi>Abraham</hi> alſo doth acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:42909:52"/>
him to be his Son, <hi>My Son,</hi> ſaith <hi>Abraham,</hi> where you clearly ſee man may be a Son of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> and yet damned; thou hadſt thy good things in this life, but <hi>Lazarus</hi> his evil things. <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 18.9, 10. where a juſt man is preſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to beget a ſon that is a Robber, and a Shedder of blood, and that goes out in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of wickedneſs, and that in <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherein obſerve, <hi>Abraham</hi> owns no other privilege belonged to the rich man by virtue of being the Son of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but what was in this life, or in this world; Hell was his beſt portion in the world to come, which if he had been born heir to the covenant of life, how then could <hi>Abrahams</hi> affirmation have been true?</p>
            <p>Beloved, Let all ingenuous Spirits that are not willing to walk blind-fold, conſider how contrary to the whole tenor of the Goſpel this opinion is, and how deſtructive to this funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental principle of the Goſpel, the neceſſity of Chriſt, of Regeneration, and deſtroys all ſenſe of the neceſſity of converſion, and helps to harden men to deſtruction, as it did the blind <hi>Jews,</hi> who (as it appears) were fully blinded in the receipt of that opinion, that being <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> ſeed, according to the fleſh, intereſſed them in happineſs and eternal life.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, This opinion deſtroys the doctrine of the new covenant, and the nature of it, and the manner of Gods making of it with the ſoul; for to make a new covenant with the ſoul, is to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:42909:53"/>
write the Law of God in a mans heart, and in his mind, and to infuſe ſaving knowledge and faith, by which God unites the ſoul to himſelf, and ſo pardons all his ſins, and without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition conſidered in the creature, binds over himſelf to be their God freely in Chriſt, and binds over himſelf to own them to be his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And only thus, and no otherwiſe, is God ſaid to make his new covenant, with a poor ſoul. Whereas this dream would ſeem to bear you in hand, that a whole nation may be in a new covenant, and have it made with them, and yet have none of all this work wrought in their hearts.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, This opinion deſtroys the doctrine of Juſtification by faith in Chriſt, only ſeeing that it doth hold out another way than by faith, to come to Juſtification, which is by carnal birth of beleeving parents; for if a ſoul be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into a Covenant of life, I hope you are not ignorant, that Juſtification is a great pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege in the new covenant, and really the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all that are in that covenant.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, This opinion deſtroys the Doctrine and foundation of all Goſpel Churches where it is held which will appear by two things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It deſtroys the matter of the Church, you know that this is a fundamental truth, that the matter of the Church ought (now under the Goſpel) to be <hi>Saints by calling,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.2. <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Worſhippers,</hi> John 4.23. <hi>Lively Stones,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.5. <hi>Such as are redeemed from their vain converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:42909:53"/>
1 Pet. 1.18. <hi>Such brought out of darkneſs into his marvellous light,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.9.</p>
            <p>Now this error deſtroys the truth, or oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it ſelf againſt the truth of God, lying in all theſe Scriptures, it brings in the nation of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, all born of their body, their ſeeds ſeed in their generation, if you will be faithful to this principle, whereon this ſeems to be ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For the covenant of Circumciſion was not only to the next generation immediately flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from <hi>Abraham, But to thy ſeed after thee in their generations:</hi> And we ſee in that generation in Chriſts time, they were as well called <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, as <hi>Iſaac</hi> himſelf was, and they did call <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> their father.</p>
            <p>Therefore if the covenant of Circumciſion, ſhall be mans patern, we muſt neceſſarily have a Church that is national, conſiſting of ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing generations for many hundred years, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of believing perſons loins, and ſo ſet up the partition-wall again, between the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral branches, and thoſe that are wild by nature: So that this tenet doth of neceſſity deſtroy the true matter of a Church, becauſe it unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably admits into the Church all the unconverted and unregenerate children, born of the bodies of ſuch perſons, that either are or have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted believers.</p>
            <p>And as it deſtroys the matter of a Church in admitting ſuch that are not made Diſciples, ſo it occaſions ſuch as do believe, remaining in that opinion, to live in that ſin of neglect
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:42909:54"/>
of the Lords Baptiſm; contenting themſelves with that counterfeit of Baptiſm which they had in their infancy; So that this evil opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on occaſions the conſtitution of a Church or Congregation of good and bad promiſcuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and all theſe unbaptized both the good and the bad; and what light in the Goſpel have you to juſtifie ſuch an Aſſembly, to be the true Church of Chriſt, that doth conſiſt of ſome Religious people, in the Judgement of Charity, and a world of carnal children admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and received in among them, and all both the carnal and the religious never baptized with the Lords baptiſm?</p>
            <p>I do deny ſuch an Aſſembly can be owned an orderly Church of Chriſt. Thus you ſee, what a great error this is, that oppoſeth it ſelf againſt ſo many fundamental points of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>But may ſome ſay, though we receive in chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by baptiſm into our Church, we do not admit them unto the Supper. The Queſtion is, when you will admit them? See what an untroden path you are run into; Do you own your children to be in a covenant of Grace, and eternal life, and inrighted into the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of the ſame? and is Baptiſm the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of the new Covenant, and not the Supper alſo? if it be, how dare you keep them from their right and privilege, I pray you? how long did the Apoſtles baptize their members, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they admitted them to the Supper?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:42909:54"/>If you look in <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41, 42. you ſhall find ſo many as gladly received the word of God were baptized, and preſently they continued in the Apoſtles doctrine, Fellowſhip, breaking of Bread, and prayer, as ſoon as they were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</p>
            <p>Therefore you have no ground at all upon any pretence, to ſuſpend ſuch members that you own privileged in all the Ordinances of God from the Supper, which you have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into your Church by your ſuppoſed bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</p>
            <p>Thus you may ſee, what horrible Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences flow naturally, from maintaining a Covenant of eternal life in the fleſh.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, This opinion, defends another groſs error, That perſons may have right to a covenant of life, without union or in-being in Chriſt by faith; it is a ſad thing that ſouls that profeſs knowledge In the Goſpel, and to be preachers of the ſame, ſhould be ſo blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thus to miſlead people in ſo weighty a point as this is, and that ſhould endeavour to leaven thouſands of poor people with ſuch a ſad error that oppoſeth it ſelf againſt the very ſubſtance of the Goſpel, in holding all the whole Nation of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to be in a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of eternal life, and alſo the carnal chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of believing parents, among the Gentiles, though they had no union by faith in Chriſt, the greateſt part of them.</p>
            <p>I come to the third thing, which is to prove
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:42909:55"/>
that the covenant of eternal life,<note place="margin">The third ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral general head.</note> never was nor ſhall be made with any, but ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, or ſuch as are in Chriſt: and for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter clearing of that you muſt underſtand that as ſoon as the ſeed of the woman was promiſed, to wit, Chriſt Jeſus, which was the whole of the new covenant, all promiſes being Yea and Amen;<note place="margin">Somewhat of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to prove that God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently upon the Fall made an outward carnal cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant entailed upon the fleſh.</note> and ſpiritual and heavenly bleſſings being given in him, this being one main point then to be made known to the Sons of men, that he muſt come out of the woman; You muſt, I ſay, underſtand that the Lord did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently make an outward covenant, which was typical intailed, upon the fleſh out of which the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhould come.</p>
            <p>But I muſt confeſs, this is not held forth ſo clearly till the time of <hi>Abraham,</hi> nor then ſo clear, as it was afterwards by the hands of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;</hi> But it is clear to me, that in ſubſtance the ſame covenant of Ceremonial obedience, which was given to <hi>Moſes</hi> when the people came out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> the ſame was given to <hi>Adams</hi> ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, upon the promiſe of Chriſt, which was to go on in the fleſhly line, out of which Chriſt was to come, and this to continue, till he did come in the fleſh, and then to ceaſe. The reaſon that induceth me thus to judge is this,</p>
            <p>I find <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> at the end of the year of daies bring their ſacrifice, and the one brought the firſt lings of the flock, and the fat thereof. Thus did God command the ſame

things to <hi>Iſrael</hi> by <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 34.19. &amp; 13.12, 13. And you ſee <hi>Cain</hi> brought the firſt fruits of the ground, and we find this deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Moſes,</hi> as part of the covenant to the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.4. &amp; 26.2. for ſaith the Lord, <hi>Thou ſhalt bring of all the firſt fruits of the Earth, which thou ſhalt bring of thy Land, that the Lord thy God gives thee,</hi> Micah 7.1.

            <p>Though ye do not here ſee from what rule <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> did thus do, yet we muſt take for granted, they had it from God, how elſe could <hi>Abel</hi> have performed his worſhip accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, if he had not a ground to do it by faith, and it is certain he did it in faith, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had he rule for the ſame, as <hi>Hebrews</hi> 11.4. And we find that in that time, there was a diſtinction of clean and unclean Beaſts that went into the Ark.</p>
            <p>Now what cleanneſs or uncleanneſs is here meant is by virtue of a Law; for certainly that Law which God gave to forbid ſuch beaſts and creatures was that which made one clean, and not another; and this Law was by <hi>Moſes</hi> delivered in <hi>Leviticus</hi> 11. ſpoken of to <hi>Peter</hi> in <hi>Acts</hi> 10. <hi>Call not thou unclean, what God hath made clean:</hi> and likewiſe the eating blood is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.4. or fleſh with the life thereof; the ſame <hi>Moſes</hi> gave <hi>Leviticus</hi> 17.10, 11. where blood is forbidden upon the ſame ground and reaſon.</p>
            <p>We find <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5. that God hints at a ſin
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:42909:56"/>
of the old world, for which he brought the flood, which was, that the Sons of God, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the daughters of men, ſeeing they were fair, which muſt needs be underſtood, there was a Law prohibiting <hi>Seths</hi> poſterity to marry with <hi>Cains,</hi> This Law was alſo given by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> in <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.2, 3. We muſt of neceſſity un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, theſe Laws were from God to <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo to his Sons, and ſo in ſubſtance, the ſame was given to <hi>Abraham</hi> with ſome additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the ſame by <hi>Moſes,</hi> committed to wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with further additions, but this is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult, that I would come to, God having promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ſeed of the woman to come out of that fleſh, did inſtitute an external covenant of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, that the Lord did carry all along upon the fleſh, or line, out of which the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhould come; and in which fleſh, the Word would be incarnate, I underſtand upon the firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Chriſt to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> God then made this made this Ceremonial covenant of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with <hi>Adams</hi> family, therefore both his Sons were trained up as Worſhippers, and this muſt needs be, becauſe <hi>Cain</hi> was never in a covenant of Grace, nor we have no ground to judge, that he had ever any appearance of true grace in him, but God having no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to bring his promiſed ſeed out of <hi>Cain</hi> or <hi>Abel,</hi> and alſo reſolved there ſhould be a world as well as a Church, he ſuffers <hi>Cain</hi> to murther <hi>Abel,</hi> upon which he rejects <hi>Cain</hi> with all his poſterity, as a Fugitive and a Vagabond from
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:42909:56"/>
what did he reject him? but from this Church Covenant of Ceremonial obedience and worſhip; but when <hi>Seth</hi> was born, God (as it appears to me) did renew a freſh Election upon him, and his ſeed according to the fleſh, and the whole Race of <hi>Seth</hi> were Gods Church. God here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by teaching, that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> muſt come out of that Family according to the fleſh, and not out of <hi>Cains</hi> or his poſterity, nor any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>And when God had deſtroyed the world by the Flood, then there was only <hi>Noahs</hi> Family, conſiſting of eight perſons, being all of them, in this Church covenant of worſhip for a time, till God pitched a freſh election upon <hi>Sem</hi> by the mouth of <hi>Noah</hi> his Father, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.26. where <hi>Ham</hi> and <hi>Japhet</hi> with their poſterities are paſt by, though as truly the ſeed of believing <hi>Noah</hi> as <hi>Sem</hi> was. And this Ceremonial covenant of Works, goes on upon <hi>Sem</hi> till the time of <hi>Abraham;</hi> the world growing then nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, God would have his Church in a more narrow compaſs, and more eſpecially take un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him that particular family out of which Chriſt ſhould come, which was <hi>Abraham.</hi> So that by the way obſerve.</p>
            <p>The main ground upon which God elects <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> family into the outward Covenant with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and not <hi>Lots,</hi> nor any of the reſt of the Godly families then living in the world. It was not becauſe <hi>Abraham</hi> was any more a believer or his family the family of a believer; for if ſo,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:42909:57"/>
then <hi>Lot,</hi> and his family, and all the godly mens families then in the world, had been ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily taken into the covenant of Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe they and their families had been believers as well as <hi>Abrahams;</hi> for this is a ſure Rule, if God give a promiſe or a command to any perſon, conſidered in ſuch a capacity as a Believer, then whoſoever is a Believer, that command and promiſe belongs unto them. I might by manifold inſtances clear this, as when God ſaith to <hi>Joſhua,</hi> I will not leave thee nor forſake thee; This being not made to him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any other conſideration, but as a Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle is bold to ſay, this promiſe is made to the whole Church of the <hi>Hebrews, Heb.</hi> 13.5. they being all believers as <hi>Joſhua</hi> was, but this covenant of Circumciſion now ſo term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was made with <hi>Abraham</hi> his ſeed and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">Why the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion made to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> and his ſeed, and not to others.</note> and not upon this ground, becauſe he was a believer, but becauſe that Chriſt muſt come out of his fleſh and line; therefore to confirm and ratify this to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that Chriſt ſhould ſo come, and to point out to all the world, where they muſt look for and expect the Chriſt; God doth as much as ſay, in <hi>Abrahams</hi> loyns you muſt expect him, and no where elſe; For as Chriſt ſaith to the woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> The Jews know what they worſhip, for ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is of the Jews; therefore to be ſure the Covenant of worſhip runs in that line.</p>
            <p>But now <hi>Abraham</hi> had eight Sons, the one
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:42909:57"/>
by <hi>Sarah, Gen.</hi> 21.2. the other by <hi>Hagar, Gen.</hi> 16. and ſix ſons by his wife <hi>Keturah, Gen.</hi> 25.1, 26. to which he gave gifts, and ſent away to the Eaſt Countrey from his ſon <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and this Covenant of Works did belong onely to <hi>Iſaac</hi> and his ſeed. For when God had in <hi>Geneſis</hi> 11.17, 7. promiſed that he would be the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his ſeed in their generations; and give them <hi>Canaan,</hi> in the concluſion of this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant he begins to ſpeak to <hi>Abraham</hi> of a Son he ſhould have by <hi>Sarah,</hi> and that ſhe ſhould be the Mother of Nations, as in <hi>Hebrews</hi> 11. <hi>Abraham</hi> being affected with his Son <hi>Iſhmael</hi> which he then enjoied, ſaith, <hi>O that</hi> Iſhmael <hi>might live in thy ſight,</hi> as if <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould ſay, Lord I underſtand that thou haſt made a Church Covenant with me, and my ſeed after me, taking my ſeed in their Generations into external Covenant with thee, O (as if he ſhould ſay) that <hi>Iſhmael</hi> might be the ſeed upon which this Covenant might run, where God tells <hi>Abraham</hi> that he had heard his prayer, that he would bleſs <hi>Iſhmael</hi> with manifold outward bleſſings otherwiſe, but ſaith he, my covenant ſhall be with <hi>Iſaac,</hi> meaning here, that outward covenant of Circumciſion, where you have <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> and the ſix Sons of <hi>Keturah</hi> with all their poſterity paſt by, in this freſh Election of <hi>Iſaac</hi> and his ſeed, which were only elected in this covenant.</p>
            <p>Therefore the bond child, and the ſix Sons of <hi>Keturah,</hi> though as truly believers children, as
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:42909:58"/>
               <hi>Iſaac</hi> was, yet they are all diſmiſſed this covenant and privileges of the ſame.</p>
            <p>The ſix Sons by <hi>Keturah,</hi> as you have heard before, <hi>Abraham</hi> gave them gifts, and ſent them into the Eaſt Countrey. And when <hi>Iſaac</hi> had two Sons in <hi>Rebeccus</hi> womb, God again made a freſh election of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and his ſeed in their Generations, paſſing by <hi>Eſau,</hi> and his ſeed; for ſaith God, There are two Nations in thee, and two peoples; So he choſe <hi>Jacob,</hi> conſidered as a Nation, and paſt by <hi>Eſau,</hi> conſidered as another Nation; for it is plain from thoſe words, there are two Nations, and two peoples, that the Election was a National Election, and a National rejection; and he ſaith, <hi>The Elder ſhall ſerve the younger;</hi> this ſaying the Elder ſhall ſerve the younger, is interpreted by <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. to be a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and a hating of <hi>Eſau,</hi> laying his Mountain waſt, that is, his Church-power or privilege, that he ſeemingly had expected to have been heir of, and the loving of <hi>Jacob,</hi> is meant the external electing Love, into the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Circumciſion, according to that in <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.7. Speaking thereof the whole Nation, The Lord did not ſet his love upon you, not chuſe you, becauſe you were more in number than any people, for you were the feweſt of all people, but becauſe the Lord loved you.</p>
            <p>This Election, and this love, is equal alike to the whole nation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> therefore ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered you muſt mind, this is, as I ſaid before, only an external election of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and theſe in
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:42909:58"/>
his lines, into the National covenant of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, as before in <hi>Geneſis</hi> 18. he ſaith, <hi>In</hi> Iſaac <hi>ſhall thy ſeed be called;</hi> the meaning as the 17. Chapter expounds, is this; that the ſeed in their Generations, that God would continue the Covenant of Circumciſion upon, was that ſeed which was to come out of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and not that which came out of <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> and the ſix Sons of <hi>Keturah,</hi> none of them or their ſeed, were to be of that great Nation which God promiſed to make of <hi>Abraham,</hi> for the Lord ſaith to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Gen.</hi> 18.18. I will make a mighty nation of thee.</p>
            <p>Now by this Nation you muſt underſtand, is meant the National Church, taken into the Covenant of Circumciſion, whereas in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual covenant, all the Nations were to be bleſt in him, and he is to be the Father of mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of Nations, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.3. &amp; 17.4, 5. but this Covenant of Circumciſion, muſt not relate to any but to thoſe that came out of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> with his family, and then thoſe that came out of the Loins of <hi>Jacob,</hi> with his Family, though this be a true literal interpretation of theſe Texts and really the proper mind of God, yet there is a myſtical and ſpiritual ſenſe pointed and driven at, which <hi>Paul,</hi> that infallible A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, did clearly give out from thoſe Texts in <hi>Romans</hi> 9. That as <hi>Iſaac</hi> typed out Chriſt ſo this temporal ſeed elected in <hi>Iſaac,</hi> typed out this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual election in Chriſt; the temporal ſeed in a temporal covenant elected in <hi>Jacob,</hi> points out the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:42909:59"/>
choice of Chriſt and all his ſeed into a ſpiritual covenant.</p>
            <p>So a ſpiritual election in theſe Texts, was ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and figured out, as the Apoſtle doth clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maintain. The Apoſtles not being the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Letter, but the Spirit 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. but moſt true it is, That <hi>Jacob,</hi> and the whole Nation in him, were elected into an outward Covenant, and <hi>Eſau,</hi> and his ſeed were not, but were refuſed and paſt by. And conſider now in the womb, was <hi>Jacob</hi> and his poſterity any more the ſeed of a Believer, than <hi>Eſau</hi> and his ſeed were? Sure it is, he was not: Therefore away with that error taken for granted, that the covenant of Circumciſion was made to believers and their ſeed.</p>
            <p>This covenant of Circumciſion you may clearly ſee, was not made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> nor to his ſeed conſidered as a Believers, but upon this ground or reaſon, that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was to come of <hi>Abraham,</hi> not of <hi>Lot;</hi> the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> was to come out of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and not of <hi>Iſhmael;</hi> nor of the ſix Sons of <hi>Keturah,</hi> and Chriſt was to come out of <hi>Jacob</hi> and his poſterity, and not out of <hi>Eſau.</hi> Here you may nakedly ſee, how great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they miſtake, that think the covenant was made to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed conſidered as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers and believers ſeed.</p>
            <p>If a National covenant was made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed according to the fleſh, out of which fleſh, the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was to come, and that upon this reaſon then you cannot conclude, that the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:42909:59"/>
covenant can belong to any Gentile and his ſeed but upon the ſame ground. Therefore if you would tell where to find a Gentile now among many others that were to have Chriſt to come out of his loins according to the fleſh, then you would have the ſame ground to ſay, that in like manner a Church covenant ſhould run upon him and his ſeed, untill Chriſt were come out of that fleſh or line.</p>
            <p>But when Chriſt was come and fully exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited in the fleſh, then the ground upon which this Covenant was given, being ceaſed,<note place="margin">To defend a Covenant of life, entailed on the fleſh, is vertually to deny that Chriſt is come in the fleſh.</note> the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant alſo ceaſeth. Therefore for any man to go about to defend a covenant in the fleſh, it is a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine virtually denying, that Chriſt is come and fully manifeſted in the fleſh.</p>
            <p>Therefore you may from all that hath been ſpoken, draw this Concluſion, <hi>That there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a Covenant of eternal life, made with any but with ſuch as did and do believe, all along till Christ, not ſince.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore ſee that objection anſwered, that the ſpiritual privileges, are not leſs under the Goſpel, than under the Law, though we deny all the carnal Generation, to have any right to the covenant of Grace or privileges there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; both then as well as now, the offers and tenders of the Goſpel we muſt confeſs, were to that Nation; and in that ſenſe, they were called the children of the Prophets, and of the covenant <hi>Acts</hi> 3. <hi>and latter end,</hi> and in that reſpect
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:42909:60"/>
now the privileges are larger, becauſe all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are in the ſame ſenſe, the children of the Prophets, and of the covenant, now ſince Chriſt came, the Prophet and Miniſter of God, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Commiſſion now to publiſh the Goſpel or new Covenant to all Nations.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">None have right to the Covenant of Grace, but ſuch as are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited to Chriſt by faith.</note>But further, to prove that none have right to a covenant of Grace or life, but ſuch as had and have union with Chriſt by faith, is moſt plain.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe as you have heard, the new Covenant was confirmed of God in Chriſt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.17. And all the promiſes are in Chriſt Yea and Amen.</p>
            <p>Therefore this Covenant cannot belong to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſoul out of Chriſt, becauſe they are Yea and Amen in him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.25. This Cup is the New Teſtament in my blood ſaith Chriſt, If the New Teſtament be in Chriſts blood, then what hath any carnal or unbelieving wretch to do with this Teſtament, that have not faith in his blood.</p>
            <p>And further we do find in <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.17. the Lord ſaith, <hi>This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed;</hi> mark the words, <hi>in whom;</hi> then to be ſure out of him, he is not well pleaſed; that is, in reſpect to this eſpecial well pleaſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or electing love in the covenant of life, according to that in <hi>Epheſians</hi> 1.6. He hath made us accepted in the Beloved; out of the beloved there can be no acceptation, Therfore it is ſaid, <hi>God accepted</hi> Abel <hi>and his offering,</hi>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:42909:60"/>
Gen. 4.4. The Author to the <hi>Hebrewe ch.</hi> 11.4. tells you, Abel <hi>by Faith offered a more acceptable</hi> or excellent <hi>Sacrifice than</hi> Cain, <hi>by which he obtained witneſs, that he was righteous; So by Faith in the promiſed ſeed he came to be righteous and accepted of God, as you have heard in</hi> Epheſ 1.3. <hi>God hath bleſt us with all ſpiritual, and heavenly bleſſings in Heavenly things in Christ Jeſus;</hi> Therefore no heavenly or ſpiritual bleſſing can belong to any out of Chriſt; for as in <hi>Adam</hi> all dy, ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive; There is none made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, but thoſe that are in Chriſt, for the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mens reſurrection is not ſaid to be to life, but to damnation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>1. with <hi>John</hi> 5.28, 29. <hi>And therefore in thee ſhall all the Nations of the Earth be bleſſed,</hi> Gen. 18.18. muſt imply thus much, that out of Chriſt the true ſeed, all the Nations ſhould be accurſed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.3. with 22.18. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.8. I muſt confeſs it is a ſad thing, that at ſuch a time of the world as this, where the means of grace and knowledge of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel hath been ſo plentifully held forth, that we muſt be forced to beſtow ſuch pains to prove, that men cannot be in a State of ſalvation and acceptation before God in a covenant of grace, without union in Chriſt by Faith. But howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, conſidering that the Apoſtle ſaith, There is no other name under heaven by which we can be ſaved, but by the name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and a particular faith in him, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.12. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith in <hi>John</hi> 6.69. <hi>Whether ſhall we go? Thou hast the words of eternal life, he is the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:42909:61"/>
way, the truth, and the life,</hi> John 14.6. <hi>There is none can come into the Fathers love and mercy,</hi> nor into the covenant of life, or any ſpiritual privilege, <hi>but by him, he is the narrow way that leads to life, and few there be that find it,</hi> as <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.14: therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>He that hath Christ hath life, but he that hath not Chriſt, hath not life;</hi> but all the carnal unbelieving children, from the foundation of the world unto this day, have not Chriſt, therefore not life, that is to ſay, nor the covenant of life nor the juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of life, which every man muſt needs have, that is in that covenant of life. We find that all the Patriarchs and holy men of God, by faith and patience, inherited the promiſes, and not by generation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.12. and 11.12. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſprang there, even of one, and him as good as dead, ſo many as the Stars in the ſky for multitude, and as the Sand which is by the Sea ſhore, innumerable, theſe all dyed in Faith.</p>
            <p>This text ſpeaks of that ſpiritual and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which he conſidered as believing and faithfull, <hi>Abraham</hi> was the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of, according to <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.5, 6. ſo ſhall thy ſeed be.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It further appears, that the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of eternal life, was never made with any but ſuch as believe, becauſe all unbelievers both of <hi>Jews</hi> and Gentiles are charged under ſin, <hi>Romans</hi> 3.9. and have the wrath of God abiding on them, <hi>John</hi> 3. <hi>laſt.</hi> Yea though of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:42909:61"/>
the ſeed of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and children of that cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Circumciſion, to them Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Except ye believe that I am he, you ſhall dy in your ſins, John</hi> 8.24. And the Goſpel tells the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church of the <hi>Jews, John</hi> 3.18. That thoſe of them that beleeved not, were condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned already becauſe they believed not in the only begotten Son of God.</p>
            <p>Which clearly proves, that none of them were in a covenant of life by Generation, for if they had, then the want of converſion, would not have damned them, nor left them in a ſtate of damnation.</p>
            <p>Further, doth not Chriſt himſelf, call and account the unbelieving <hi>Jews</hi> the world? when he ſaith to his diſciples, <hi>If you were of the world, the world would love his own, but becauſe you are not of the world, but I have choſen you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.</hi> And this world that Chriſt chuſeth his diſciples out of, and that hated his diſciples as they had formerly hated him, are but the Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that were in that covenant of Circumciſion, which plainly proves, that all unbelievers in that nation were the world, and therefore not in a covenant of Grace.</p>
            <p>And again, it muſt needs be ſo, becauſe the Apoſtle ſaith in <hi>Romans</hi> 4.16. therefore is it of Faith, that it might be by Grace, to the end that the promiſe might be ſure to all the ſeed.</p>
            <p>Obſerve from the Text, if the promiſe, or covenant, or any ſpiritual privilege, ſhould
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:42909:62"/>
be intailed upon the fleſh, or conveyed any way then by Faith, it could not be by Grace.</p>
            <p>And again, Faith is the firſt differencing Grace, to difference Gods peopl from all other, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.9. and put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is impoſſible the covenant of grace, can be made to any other but ſuch as have faith. And again, I find none counted the Spiritual ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> unto whom the covenant of life belongs, but them that are in Chriſt by faith, as <hi>Gallat.</hi> 3.28, 29. There is neither <hi>Jew</hi> nor Gentile, there is neither Bond nor Free, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Male nor Female, for you are all one in Chriſt Jeſus, and if you be in Chriſt, then are you <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, and heirs according to the promiſe, and ſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.14. <hi>If they which were of the Law be heirs, Faith is made void, and the promiſe made of none effect,</hi> meaning thereby the Covenant of Circumciſion, as appears in <hi>ver.</hi> 10. <hi>&amp;</hi> 11. and ſo in <hi>Romans</hi> 9.7, 8. <hi>Not becauſe they are the ſeed of</hi> Abraham, <hi>are they all children, but in</hi> Iſaac <hi>ſhall thy ſeed be called,</hi> that is, they which are the children of the fleſh, they are not the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, but the children of the promiſe, are counted for the ſeed.</p>
            <p>Where you ſee, that the Apoſtle doth deny that ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that were only his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren according to the fleſh, to be the ſpiritual ſeed; but ſuch as are born of promiſe, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by promiſe, they are accounted for the ſeed choſen in him, and united to him by Faith.</p>
            <p>

            <p>It is moſt true, that ſo many as God ſhall call, have an intereſt, both to Chriſt and all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes in him, and only they, for ſaith the Text, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and be baptized every one of you for the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

did belong to the Generation of the <hi>Jews</hi> whether they were called or not, though they continued in unbelief and hardneſs of heart and impenitency?

            <p>But if by the children you underſtand, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them as God ſhould call, whether then at that time, or afterwards to the end of the world, it is moſt true, that to ſuch of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren the promiſe of grace did belong.</p>
            <p>But Beloved, the Scripture is in nothing more full than in this, that the promiſe of grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed not to any of thoſe <hi>Iews</hi> ſeed, but ſuch as were called; for God ſhuts them under unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and becauſe of unbelief they were broken off. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. if unbelief excluded them from that external relation, which before Chriſts death they then had in the Covenant intailed on the fleſh, and Chriſt coming in the fleſh, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exhibiting and putting an end to that cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, no other covenant ſtanding in force in the Church of God, but what Chriſt was the Mediator of, theſe unbelieving <hi>Iews</hi> of neceſſity were bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off. The promiſe of remiſſion of ſins was ſo far

from running upon the unbelieving <hi>Jews,</hi> the true fleſhly ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> affirms the contrary, <hi>Acts</hi> 19.9. But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but ſpake evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them; and <hi>Acts</hi> 13.45, 46. But when the Jews ſaw the multitude, they were filled with envy, and ſpake againſt thoſe things that were ſpoken by <hi>Paul,</hi> contradicting and blaſpheming, then <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> waxed bold, and ſaid, it was neceſſary that the word of God ſhould firſt have been ſpoken to you, but ſeeing ye put it from you and judge your ſelves unworthy of everlaſting life? Lo, we turn to the Gentiles, for ſo hath the Lord commanded us, and v 50. the <hi>Iews</hi> ſtirred up the devout and honorable women, and raiſed perſecution againſt <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> but they ſhook off the duſt of their feet againſt them; and therefore <hi>Paul</hi> is plain in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. ſaying, That God had a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain number that were of the eternal election, among the <hi>Iews,</hi> thoſe obtained right to the remiſſion of ſins, and the reſt were blinded and hardened, but it ſhould ſeem to be the general underſtanding of thoſe that urge this Text for a covenant in the fleſh, That if they were the ſeed of the Jews, though they were not called, nor did not believe, but were hardned in their continuance in unbelief, yet this promiſe of remiſſion of ſins, and the gift of the Holy Ghoſt, belongs to them; and this interpretation, that this Text muſt have to defend a covenant in the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:42909:65"/>
fleſh, which I leave to any intelligent man to conſider, how greatly erroneous it is to affirm that the promiſe of the remiſſion of ſins belongs to the unbelieving and hardened children of the <hi>Iews,</hi> that God hath nor, nor doth call. So that you may clearly ſee, that the truth lyes in this text, that the promiſe is to no more of Fathers nor children, nor thoſe afar off but ſuch as God by his eſpecial grace doth call to be the Sons of of God by faith.<note place="margin">An anſwer to that text 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Another Scripture made uſe of or rather a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed and wreſted to defend this error, is 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. <hi>The unbelieving husband is ſanctified by the believing wife, and the unbelieving wife is ſanctifyed by the believing husband, elſe were your children un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, but now are they holy,</hi> whence is gathered by thoſe of that opinion, that this holineſs is (as they call it) a federal holineſs, of a covenant holineſs, that is to ſay, God having taken the believing parent with the child into covenant with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, the child is in this ſenſe holy, that is cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-holy.</p>
            <p>Now for the better underſtanding this Text, I pray conſider how, and in what ſenſe, God takes perſons into Covenant with himſelf; and that as you have heard is two waies, either he takes ſouls to himſelf in a typical covenant, ſo he took <hi>Iſrael</hi> to himſelf in that covenant, and in that ſenſe they may be ſaid to be ſeparated from the reſt of the World, which ſeparation of them from the reſt of the World to himſelf is a holineſs that the carnal <hi>Iew</hi> was only partaker
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:42909:66"/>
of, ſuch a typical and legal holineſs, that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple being ſeparated from all other nations in the world to God in this covenant: now the word holy ſignifies ſo much as ſeparating or ſetting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, and in this ſenſe the Veſſels of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were holy, as alſo the Prieſts, being by Law ſet apart from the reſt of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to offer the bread of their God.</p>
            <p>Now in the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. place, there is alſo a new covenant or a covenant of life, that God takes a people to himſelf, which is to write his Law in their hearts, &amp; in their minds, to ſanctify the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to juſtify them. Now this internal holineſs which God as an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of that Covenant infuſeth into the heart, is only this new Covenant-holineſs, for there is no other holineſs that relates to the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; when the heart and the inward man ſhall be purified through faith. And when the whole heart and affections, are by the powerful work of Gods grace, ſeparated from ſin, and thoſe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities below to heaven and heavenly things, this is the only holineſs that the covenant of eternal life conveys to ſouls. The Hypocrite may have this in appearance, but the elect and choſen have this only in truth; he puts no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith, and he hath by one offering for ever per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected them that are ſanctified, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. this ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification of the Spirit and belief of the Truth goes alwaies together, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13. Therefore it is impoſſible that this ſhould be the meaning of the Text, that all believers carnal ſeed, are in a
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:42909:66"/>
covenant of eternal life, and ſo have their hearts purified and ſanctified through the work of the Spirit and faith, before they are born, and in this ſenſe, are born holy.</p>
            <p>I know no other ſanctification the Scripture ſpeaks of belonging to a covenant of grace and eternal life; and for that external or typical ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneſs in an outward covenant it cannot be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that was aboliſhed through Chriſts death, as appears in <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.9. chapters, therefore far be it from the Apoſtle to intend here, the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancing of any ſuch erronious opinion, as that every believers Child was by virtue of his firſt birth, internally holy with that holineſs of truth, as the Apoſtle calls it, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.24.</p>
            <p>If you pleaſe therefore, hearken to the true meaning of this text, which is to this effect: The <hi>Corinthians</hi> having ſent ſeveral doubts and queſtions to the Apoſtle to reſolve and anſwer, as appears in the firſt verſe of this chapter; he anſwereth them particularly, and it ſeems among the reſt, they had a <hi>Jewiſh</hi> queſtion ſtarted, ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (as we ſuppoſe) upon <hi>Ezra</hi> 9. <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.2. where you find it was unlawful for a <hi>Jew</hi> to marry with a ſtranger; therefore <hi>Ezra</hi> cauſed all thoſe men that had taken them ſtrange wives, to put them away, as not lawfully married, becauſe contrary and againſt the Law given to them, therefore they were to put them away, and the children born of them as illegitimate and unclean in an unlawful fellowſhip.</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> it ſeems, did propound in
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:42909:67"/>
writing to the Apoſtle this queſtion, whether ſuch of them as had unbelieving huſbands and wives yet reimaining in idolatry might lawfully abide with them in that fellowſhip in the marriage-bed, and whether that fellowſhip were not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean and unlawfull, as in <hi>Ezra's</hi> time?</p>
            <p>Unto this queſtion the Apoſtle anſwers verſe 12. <hi>To the rest ſpeak I, not the Lord. If any Brother hath a Wife that believeth not, and ſhe be pleaſed to dwell with thim, let him not put her away, and the woman which hath a husband which believeth not, and if he be pleaſed to dwell with her, let her not leave him;</hi> But alſo might they ſay; why is not our marriage fellowſhip unclean? Therefore in ver. 14. ſaith he, <hi>The unbelieving wife is ſanctifyed</hi> (as the <hi>Geneva</hi> Tranſlation hath it) <hi>to the believing Husband, or elſe were your children unclean, but now are they holy.</hi> As if <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould ſay, the reaſon why I would have the believing huſband to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide with the unbelieving wife, is this, becauſe the unbeliever (now ſince the partition-wall is down between <hi>Jew</hi> and Gentile) may juſtifiably be a wife to a believing Huſband, there being now no Law in the New Teſtament againſt ſuch marriages, eſpecially conſidering their marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age was tranſacted, when they were both Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Heathen.</p>
            <p>Now it being taken for granted their marriage was lawful in theſe words, <hi>The unbelieving wife is ſanctified to the believing Husband,</hi> and that it be underſtood, that the unbelieving huſband is by the Law of Marriage ſanctified to, or ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:42909:67"/>
or ſeparated to, or made holy to the believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wife, the Law of marriage having ſeparated him from all other women in the world to be to her, and her only, elſe were your children un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, Mark, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Elſe were your children unclean, but now are they holy,</hi> that is, if the Law of God did not ſet the unbeliever apart to the believer, and ſo juſtify their fellowſhip in the marriage bed, then would the children be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten in that fellowſhip, be unclean and baſe born, but now they are holy, that is, now they are begotten in holy wedlock according to the holy law of marriage, not as thoſe children were in <hi>Ezraes</hi> time which were unclean: So that from the unbelievers lawful and ſanctified abode with the believer, doth the Apoſtle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the children to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> clean or holy. And thus all children of Heathen are in the ſame ſenſe holy, that are begotten in holy wedlock, for as the fellowſhip of man and woman in the bed being not according to the Law, is called fornication, uncleanneſs and unholineſs, ſo the fellowſhip of any two perſons even of Heathen, being according to that Law of marriage, it is then clean or holy, and ſo the children begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in that fellowſhip, are ſaid to be clean or holy begotten. But there was none doubted of the holineſs of the Heathen, they never having any law to prohibit their marriage together, but now the <hi>Jews</hi> having an expreſs Law againſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying with any other nation, it was legally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean or unholy, to match with any ſuch, or to
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:42909:68"/>
bed with any ſuch that were not <hi>Jews</hi> or Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes.</p>
            <p>Now that Law you muſt mind, was part of the partition-wall between <hi>Jew</hi> and Gentile, which is aboliſhed ſince Chriſts full exhibition, ſo then take the ſenſe of the text thus:</p>
            <p>That firſt the Apoſtle bids the Believers conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue with the unbelievers or Idolaters.</p>
            <p>Secondly, adding this reaſon, becauſe their fellowſhip is holy.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, From an abſurdity, which would elſe follow, and that is, <hi>Elſe were your children unclean, but now are they holy.</hi>

            <p>The uſual expoſition is, That this root is <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> and theſe firſt-fruits, are <hi>Abraham, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and theſe Branches are to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, the body of <hi>Iſrael</hi> that came of their Loins, as the root and the branches.

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:42909:68"/>
that the Gentile and his ſeed is brought in. What is there in that text which will countenance that clauſe, if it be truly examined?</p>
            <p>But let us conſider this Text, and ſee what it will afford to prove a covenant of eternal life, to life, to run in the fleſh of believing Gentiles, for that is it the Text muſt prove, without the which in vain it is alleged. And for the better exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining of the ſame, we will take for granted, that by root, is meant <hi>Abraham,</hi> and by Firſt-fruits is meant <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> which are ſpoken of: If ſo, then you muſt of neceſſity di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh <hi>Abraham,</hi> as the Apoſtle doth, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting and working <hi>Abraham,</hi> and as believing and faithful <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſo thus you muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, <hi>Abraham</hi> in a two-fold Covenant, as hath been before cleared.

            <p>Now all the Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> being ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by God from all other Nations in and by the ſame Covenant, are in this ſenſe holy, as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was, and as he was holy in a Covenant of life with a ſpiritual holineſs, ſo only thoſe of the ſpiritual and believing ſeed as his branches in that ſenſe can be ſaid to be holy.</p>
            <p>And the like may be ſaid of theſe Patriarchs who as the firſt fruits, conſider them in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual covenant, ſo they as the firſt fruits may be

ſaid to be ſpiritually holy. So by the Lump you muſt underſtand that ſeed in that covenant, to be only ſpiritually holy, as the firſt fruits were. But if you conſider them in the covenant of works, the external National covenant as the firſt fruit in that covenant were legally holy: ſo were the whole lump, that is the whole Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> thus holy, till that covenant was abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed and put an end to; and then this covenant intailed on the fleſh of <hi>Abraham,</hi> being put an end to or aboliſhed, it muſt needs be that the branches muſt be broken off, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as only by nature or birth had an Intereſt to that cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, or joining only to the family.</p>

which God had choſe out of</hi> Iſrael: Then ſaith he, <hi>If by grace, then not by works? if by works, then not by grace?</hi> Where you hear the Apoſtle clearly diſtinguiſheth two ſeeds in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as two cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants; the one a conditional covenant of works, the other of grace, an abſolute covenant, as in the 4, 5, 6, 7. verſes of that 11. of the <hi>Romans;</hi> and ſo the main drift here of the Apoſtle, is to hold forth, that though God did now caſt off from being his Church, the carnal ſeed, that were only in the covenant of works, this covenant ſtanding no longer in force, but growing old and vaniſhing away, as in <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.13. in which cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant he choſe this nation to himſelf; yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, the Apoſtle doth affirm, that God had a remnant that were elect, that ſhould be called of that natural ſeed of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> even to the end, though for the preſent, the greateſt part were hardened in unbelief. So that when he ſaith the branches were broken off, we are not to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that ſuch of them as related to <hi>Abraham</hi> as a Father or Root of Believers in a Covenant of grace, were broken off; For then we ſhould hold falling away from and out of a Covenant of life; which would be a groſs error: but the branches were broke off from the Root, conſidered in that national covenant of Circumciſion which was a Covenant of works, that carnal people might really be in, as you heard before. This National Covenant now ceaſing, (as I have ſhewed) and being put an end to by Chriſt, he becomming the ſubſtance of the ſame covenant,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:42909:70"/>
and that being the partition wall at that time, between <hi>Jews</hi> and Gentiles.</p>
            <p>But the Apoſtle now affirms in <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. and 6.16. <hi>That Circumciſion availeth not any thing, nor <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion, but a New Creature and Faith that worketh by Love;</hi> therefore all of the <hi>Jews</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved not, ceaſed to be members of Gods Church. Becauſe now <hi>Abraham</hi> is no way conſidered as a Father and a Root in the Goſpel Church; but as faithful and believing <hi>Abraham</hi> in a Covenant of eternal life, therefore unbelief now cuts off the nation of the <hi>Jews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Why had not unbelief cut them off many hundred years before?</hi> The anſwer is plain, for ſo long as the typical covenant of works ſtood in force, <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> by being of that family or that generation, whether they had faith or no, or any appearance of grace or no, were intereſſed in that covenant and in the privileges thereof.</p>
            <p>But now when Chriſt was fully exhibited in the fleſh, and that covenant ceaſing and the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of life (now) only remaining, it becomes ſo that only thoſe branches and that lump of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, the ſpiritual lump only remain in the Church whether <hi>Jews</hi> or Gentiles.</p>
            <p>So that if you will ſeriouſly mind the ſcope and drift of the Apoſtle, you ſhall ſee, that the Lump and the Branches, here intended, muſt needs be holy, becauſe the Firſt-fruits and Root are holy, which is meant thoſe of Gods ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al elect of the <hi>Jews</hi> that he would call, to the end of the world, which ſince is confirmed in the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:42909:70"/>
28. verſe, For ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>As concerning the Goſpel they are enemies for your ſakes,</hi> meaning the Gentiles, <hi>but as touching the election they are beloved for the Fathers ſake.</hi> Not as if God hated theſe rejected <hi>Jews</hi> for the ſakes of theſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles properly, or loved a certain number of the <hi>Jews</hi> for their fathers ſake properly.</p>
            <p>But thus for the Goſpels ſake they became e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, that is, the Goſpel promiſe or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, having (as you have heard before) reſpect to all Nations, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.3. <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.18. with <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.8.</p>
            <p>Now this Goſpel Covenant being not capable to be divulged to all Nations ſo long as this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal electing love to the Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> was kept on foot in that Covenant of Circumciſion, being a partition-wall, therefore this bond of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and frendſhip, being broken in this exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal covenant, they came to be enemies, becauſe of the accompliſhment of the promiſes of the Goſpel to the Gentiles, that thoſe beloved e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and ten Tribes even are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved for their Fathers ſake, meaning for the promiſe ſake, made to their fathers concerning their calling, which muſt needs be accompliſhed, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 65.23. for they are the ſeed of the bleſſed of the Lord, and their off-ſpring with them, meaning all ſuch elected off-ſpring, as this 11 of the <hi>Romans</hi> ſpeaks of the calling, For ſaith the Text, <hi>As touching the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they were beloved for the Fathers ſake,</hi> ſo that for
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:42909:71"/>
the promiſe ſake made to their Fathers, they ſhall in time be actually elected with an eternal elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting love.</p>
            <p>But to mind this Scripture further, it makes exceedingly againſt any fleſhly covenant running in the fleſhly line of the Gentiles, becauſe that theſe words in verſe the 20. to the 24. do declare that the Gentiles came to be <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſpiritual ſeed, and ſo a branch of that ſtock, only by faith in Chriſt that fat Olive; For if you are Chriſts, then are ye <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, and heirs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to promiſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. <hi>laſt.</hi> And as it is ſaid the Gentiles are graffed into this ſtock or root of <hi>Abraham</hi> contrary to nature, it muſt needs cut off ſuch a concluſion as, <hi>That all believing Gentiles ſeed ſhall come by nature into this Stock.</hi> It being not only againſt the whole ſcope and drift of this place, but againſt the expreſs words which ſaith, the Gentiles are graffed in contrary to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſtand by faith, and further that unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief broke off the <hi>Jews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this would be a ſtrange riddle (in my judgement) firſt to conclude, that the whole nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> were in a Covenant of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, and yet never had faith, no not ſo much as viſibly for the greateſt part of them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That they were broken off, from a Covenant of eternal life, and why? becauſe of unbelief. And yet nevertheleſs, believing Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles their unbelieving ſeed, in the midſt of his unbelief is grafted in.</p>
            <p>This in ſubſtance is what is drawn from this
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:42909:71"/>
text for proving a covenant in the fleſh. But let any impartially judge, how much a ſhame it would be, to wreſt Scripture ſo contrary to the Scope and meaning. For this chapter ſhews, that there were two ſeeds, two covenants, one of Grace, or the Goſpel, the other of works, and that men could not obtain aright to this Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Covenant, but by vertue of election, and that meerly of grace, the other covenant of works, and the fleſhly ſeed in this Covenant, were broke off; that is, from any privilege comming from <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the fleſh, that fleſhly covenant being put an end to, by Chriſts being come in the fleſh: All unbelieving <hi>Jews</hi> upon that ground ceaſe to be Gods Church, much more unbelieving Gentiles; for if unbelief broke off the <hi>Jew,</hi> be ſure it will as effectually keep out the Gentile, as it is clear it doth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſtand by faith only, and are graffed in contrary to nature, and it is ſaid, the <hi>Jew,</hi> if he abide not in unbelief, ſhall be graffed in again.</p>
            <p>From all which it is plain, that there is no other way now under the Goſpel to come into, or ſtand in the houſe or Church of God but by faith, neither for <hi>Iew</hi> nor Gentile: and ſo far is the Apoſtle free from concluding, that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles come in by nature, that he affirms the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that he is graffed in contrary to nature. Plainly holding forth, that all both <hi>Iews</hi> and Gentiles, in a ſtate of unbelief, were excluded from thoſe privileges.</p>
            <p>For (as before hath been proved) the ground
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:42909:72"/>
upon which the covenant of Circumciſion was made unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his ſeed according to the fleſh, was not becauſe he was a believer; but becauſe Chriſt was to come of that line accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the fleſh.</p>
            <p>If you could find out any Gentile under the Goſpel, out of which the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhould come, according to the fleſh, then there were the ſame reaſon and ground, that an external typical co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant ſhould run in his line or fleſh, till the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> were fully exhibited.</p>
            <p>But I hope none will be ſuch an Anti-chriſt ſo highly to deny Chriſt come in the fleſh, ſeeing <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Henceforth we know no man after the fleſh,</hi> for ſaith he, <hi>We have known Chriſt after the fleſh, but henceforth we know him ſo no more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That men were known, that is, approved as privileged perſons in Gods Church by being in that covenant intailed in the fleſh of <hi>Abraham, viz.</hi> that covenant of Circumciſion; But from henceforth we know no man, no not Chriſt himſelf ſhould be minded, as ſtanding intereſſed in that covenants he being now known, to be one receiving a more excellent miniſtery, than the Miniſtry of Circumciſion, a better covenant grounded upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> better promiſes <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.6, 7. the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words confirm this Expoſition, <hi>Therfore if any man be in Chriſt he is a new Creature, old things paſs away and all things become new,</hi> compared with <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.15. <hi>It is not Circumciſion availeth any thing,</hi> &amp;c. therefore we are not now to know men accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding t the fleſh.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:42909:72"/>No not Chriſt as come in the the fleſh circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed and by virtue of that privileged in the Church. But we are now to know him as fully exhibited, and (as before) a Miniſter of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter covenant grounded upon better promiſes.</p>
            <p>So that this 11. chapter of the <hi>Romans</hi> doth ſo little ſerve to countenance the covenant of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life to run in the fleſh, that it exceedingly makes againſt it, cuts it up by the Roots, affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no other of the Gentiles or their ſeed to be graffed into this ſtock or root, but contrary to nature, which he expounds to be by faith.</p>
            <p>Therefore take the whole drift and ſcope of that place, and you ſhall have two ſeeds, two covenants, a certain ſelect number out of thoſe that were in the old Covenant, elected into the new covenant, the reſt of all the body of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in that old Covenant were blinded and harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and never obtained an intereſt into the new Covenant.</p>
            <p>And when Jeſus Chriſt the Subſtance of the old Covenant was come, then that ceaſing, and now but one covenant remaining, the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Gods Church its of neceſſity only believers and ſpiritual ſeed now can remain in the Church. Hereupon, all the unbelieving ſeed of <hi>Jews</hi> and Gentiles, are utterly exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded out from the Church, and Church-privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges which never was ſo long, as an old ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal covenant ſtood in force.</p>
            <p>The next Scripture Text,<note place="margin">An anſwer to that text, 1 Cor. 10.1, 2, 3.</note> brought in for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Covenant in the fleſh is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.1,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:42909:73"/>
2, 3. verſes, <hi>Moreover Brethreen, I would not have you ignorant, how that all our Fathers were under the Cloud, and all paſſed through the Sea, and were all baptized unto</hi> Moſes <hi>in the Cloud and in the Sea, and did all eat of that ſpiritual meat, and drink of that ſpiritual drink, for they drank of that ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Rock that followed them, and that Rock was Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is another Scripture which is made uſe of to prove a Covenant of Salvation to run in the fleſh.</p>
            <p>But beloved, the drift of the Apoſtle here is (as it is throughout the Scripture) to give out the myſtery and ſubſtance, that ſhadows typed out to come, according to that in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>We are not Miniſters of the Letter, but of the Spirit;</hi> meaning, that the main thing which the Apoſtles did hold forth in their Miniſtery, when they had to do with types and ſhadows was, to ſet forth the ſubſtance or Spirit, or heavenly things that was pointed at, and ſo here.</p>
            <p>Beloved know this, that theſe were all types and ceremonies here ſpoke of, belonging to the carnal Jew, therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>They were all baptized unto</hi> Moſes <hi>in the Cloud and in the Sea;</hi> He doth not ſay they were all baptized into Chriſt, but unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> which is a main paſſage I would preſent to you.</p>
            <p>You muſt underſtand <hi>Moſes</hi> was a ſolemn type, he was a Saviour to ſave them out of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> their preſent bondage, into <hi>Canaan:</hi> He was a Mediator of that temporal covenant,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:42909:73"/>
               <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19. and in this did <hi>Moſes</hi> type out Chriſt; the temporal Covenant, did type out the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and heavenly covenant, and the temporal <hi>Iſrael</hi> did type out the ſpiritual <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This temporal redemption of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> into <hi>Canaan,</hi> typed out the ſpiritual redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from ſin, Bondage, the World and Devil into that heavenly <hi>Canaan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Covenant that <hi>Moſes</hi> was the Mediator of (you have heard) was the covenant of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, which is before cleared to be a Covenant of works, delivered in ſubſtance to <hi>Abraham,</hi> but after committed by writing to <hi>Moſes,</hi> as <hi>Act.</hi> 15.1. where the Teachers did command them to be circumciſed and keep the Law after the manner of <hi>Moſes,</hi> compared with <hi>John</hi> 7.22. Moſes <hi>therefore gave unto you Circumciſion, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is of</hi> Moſes, <hi>but of the Father:</hi> In <hi>Acts</hi> 15.1. It is ſaid by the falſe Teachers, <hi>That except they were circumciſed after the manner of</hi> Moſes <hi>they could not be ſaved;</hi> Thoſe Teachers were of the ſame opinion with theſe in our daies, who hold that the Covenant of Circumciſion, was a Covenant of life, and therefore concluded, ſuch perſons out of it could not be ſaved; their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion was (doubtleſs) anſwerable to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes, For if that Circumciſion had been as they judged it, a Covenant of eternal life, then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of it none could have been ſaved. Therefore it is ſaid in the 5. verſe, <hi>Certain of the Sects of the Phariſees that believed, did ſay, it was needfull to Circumciſe them, and to command them to keep the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:42909:74"/>
Law of</hi> Moſes; And in the tenth verſe it is ſaid, <hi>Why tempt ye God to put a yoke upon the necks of the Diſciples, which neither our fathers nor we are able to bear;</hi> which was the Covenant of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, which on Gods part, was the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> with all the good things thereof, and the external privileges, as protection and preſervation. And on their parts, they were bound to keep the Law, therefore you ſhall find that <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> entered into an oath and a curſe with the people then to keep this covenant on their part, as that Nation were bound to do.</p>
            <p>And this was that Covenant which the falſe Teachers perſwaded the <hi>Gallatians</hi> to be a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of life, and that they could not be ſaved without it, which covenant the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> called the fleſh, in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.3. meaning that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which God had eſtabliſhed in their fleſh <hi>for an everlaſting Covenant,</hi> as he ſo calls it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.13. <hi>This ſhall be my Covenant in your fleſh, ſaith the Lord, for an everlaſting Covenant;</hi> Therefore ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.1. <hi>What ſhall we ſay that</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham <hi>our Father as appertaining to the fleſh hath found; if</hi> Abraham <hi>were justified by works?</hi> Mark his Expoſition of that Covenant, <hi>appertaining to the fleſh</hi> to be a Covenant of works, which in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>e 10. verſe he clears to be Circumciſion, in oppoſition to that Goſpel promiſe, which <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> had before he was circumciſed, and ſo he doth all along in that Chapter. Herein the 3. of <hi>Gal.</hi> he doth ſet the Covenant of grace
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:42909:74"/>
and that of works in oppoſition, the one he calls the Spirit, the other fleſh, which he moſt evidently explains in <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.1, 2, 3. where ſaith he, <hi>Stand faſt in that liberty which Christ hath made you free, and be not intangled again with the yoake of bondage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here obſerve again, that he calls it as <hi>Peter</hi> doth <hi>Acts</hi> 15.10. <hi>a yoke of bondage,</hi> which is evident that they were ſet at freedom and liberty from as that which was aboliſhed, and they freed from as a yoak, which neither they, nor their Fathers were able to hear, as appears in <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.1, 2, 3. <hi>Behold I</hi> Paul <hi>ſay to you, if ye be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed Chriſt ſhall profit you nothing:</hi> Nay in <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>For I teſtify to every one that is circumciſed, that he is a Debtor to do the whole Law,</hi> and in ver. 4. He ſets it in oppoſition to the covenant of grace, and this is explained more in <hi>Gallatians</hi> chap. 6.12, 13. verſes.</p>
            <p>Now all this conſidered, you may clearly ſee the Covenant of Circumciſion made to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and his ſeed in their Generation, that he would give them <hi>Canaan</hi> with the bleſſings there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and in that ſenſe, be their God, to protect preſerve and externally to privilege them with the means of grace, and tenders of the Goſpel, and the external bleſſings of <hi>Canaan,</hi> upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition they would be circumciſed and keep the Law.</p>
            <p>All theſe things are typical, this deliverance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> typing out the deliverance out of <hi>Hell.</hi> That temporal <hi>Iſrael</hi> after the fleſh, that
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:42909:75"/>
were redeemed out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> typed out the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual <hi>Iſrael</hi> that were redeemed out of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual bondage, and (as before hath been ſaid) <hi>Moſes</hi> then a temporal Redeemer, Mediator or Saviour, typed out Chriſt the ſpiritual Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and Saviour, therefore in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.6. The Apoſtle tells us, theſe were our figures or types.</p>
            <p>So this being premiſed, we have the ſenſe of the Text here plain, that as the ſpiritual diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple or <hi>Iſraelite</hi> when he believes and confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his faith, thereby ſhewing his intereſt in <hi>Jeſus</hi> Chriſt, is baptized into Chriſt Jeſus the Mediator of that Covenant, which he is in by faith.</p>
            <p>So the temporal <hi>Iſrael</hi> by birth, or being bought with money, or cohabitation in that family of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> comming to have a right to the Covenant of Circumciſion, whereof <hi>Moſes</hi> was the Mediator, they were likewiſe baptized unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> in the Cloud and in the Sea, that being as real a confirmation to them of the temporal deliverance from <hi>Egypt</hi> into <hi>Canaan</hi> by the hand of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as our baptiſm is a confirmation to the ſpiritual <hi>Iſrael</hi> of their ſpiritual deliverance by Jeſus their Mediator from death and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to eternal life.</p>
            <p>And whereas the Apoſtle calls that meat ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual meat, and that drink, ſpiritual drink, he here ſpeaks figuratively, as before affirmed; Not that the <hi>Manna</hi> eaten by the whole Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> was in it ſelf ſpiritual, but it was
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:42909:75"/>
a figure of the ſpiritual bread, therefore Chriſt ſaith to the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>John</hi> 6.32, 33. <hi>Verily, verily I ſay unto you,</hi> Moſes <hi>gave you not that bread from heaven, but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven.</hi> Obſerve that word <hi>Giveth,</hi> not did give, but giveth for the bread of God is that which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth down from heaven, and giveth life to the world.</p>
            <p>And therefore ſaith he, <hi>My Father giveth you the true bread from heaven,</hi> that is, the ſubſtance of that ſhadow; and ſo that rock was Chriſt, meaning a figure or type of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>What is all this, Beloved, to the proving of a Covenant of life, running in the fleſh, either then or now, to the Gentiles under the Goſpel? ſeeing it is clear, that all theſe Ordinances (as the Apoſtle calls them <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. <hi>Carnal Ordinances</hi>) did type out, or figure out, ſpiritual and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial things. For their ſacrifices for ſin, ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped out Chriſt, but they were not Chriſt, and their typical remiſſions, which they had by their ſacrifice, That remiſſion I ſay, which the whole body of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had by offering up their ſin-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing can be underſtood to be no other but typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.</p>
            <p>A man might be under that typical Remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and yet ne under the wrath of God and be damned, and a poor Gentile, at the utmoſt part of the Earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> believing as <hi>Rahab</hi> did in <hi>Canaan,</hi> as truly juſtified, though he had none of this typical remiſſion, and none of theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned figures, ſo that we conclude
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:42909:76"/>
the whole Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> had not a covenant of eternal life in the fleſh made unto them, though they had a temporal typical covenant, as I have all along called it, that is, conſiſting of ſuch Laws and privileges that had not Chriſt in them, but did point at him to come; therefore they are called in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. <hi>Patterns of Heavenly things,</hi> but not the very things themſelves. They are called by the Apoſtle, <hi>Beggarly Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or Rudiments of the World, or a School-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster to lead to Chriſt.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> literal obedience to the Law, typing out the obedience to faith, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.12, 13, 14. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. from v. 6. to the 10. ver.</p>
            <p>Now, beloved, the literal obedience in it ſelf performed by the carnal <hi>Jew,</hi> though it fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured out the ſubſtantial obedience, <hi>viz.</hi> faith in Chriſt, and though the Reſt in <hi>Canaan,</hi> typed out the ſpiritual Reſt in Chriſt, yet I hope no man will be ſo abſurd, but he will confeſs, that this litteral obedience, it was not the ſpiritual obedience, and that this reſt in <hi>Canaan</hi> it was but a ſhadow of that reſt in Chriſt, not the very reſt it ſelf.</p>
            <p>But ſome may ſay ſo of baptiſm, and the Supper, that theſe are the ſigns of inward and ſpiritual things, but it doth not follow, that theſe are the ſpiritual things.</p>
            <p>Beloved, Obſerve warily, for here lies the ground of this great miſtake, the want of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing between theſe figures that type out Chriſt to come, and theſe Sacramental ſigns,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:42909:76"/>
that do confirm and ratifie his being already come.</p>
            <p>Thoſe typical ſigns and figures then, which typed out Chriſt to come, did properly belong to that typicall ſeed the body of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped out the ſpiritual ſeed to come.</p>
            <p>But now theſe ſigns, I ſay, theſe Sacramentall ſigns that are inſtituted ſince Chriſt came, for the confirming he is come, theſe belong only to the ſpiritual ſeed, in whom Chriſt is come already dwelling in their hearts by faith.</p>
            <p>Therefore as Chriſt is a ſpiritual and ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Mediator of a Subſtantial and ſpiritual cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, ſo theſe ſpiritual Adminiſtrations of the ſpiritual covenant, belong only to ſuch as are in Chriſt, and this new Covenant by faith, and that have Chriſt dwelling in them, as hath been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the former part of my diſcourſe, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted.</p>
            <p>In the new Teſtament, Faith and Repentance, are required of them that are to be baptized, <hi>Here is Water what letteth? If thou believeſt with all thy heart it is lawful,</hi> Acts 8.38. implying it was unlawful to baptize any, that did not believe with all their heart, at leaſt in profeſſion. And ſo when Chriſt diſpenſeth the Supper. He commands it to be received by his Diſciples, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. He ſaith to his Diſciples, <hi>take eat,</hi> and he ſaid to his Diſciples, <hi>Drink ye all of this,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Examine your ſelves and ſo eat of this bread, and drink of this Cup.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you will not ſhut your eyes againſt the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:42909:77"/>
light; there is nothing more plain than this, That thoſe adminiſtrations, under the old co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, did not require ſuch qualifications, as are eſſentially requiſite to be found in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that muſt partake of theſe ſubſtantial ſigns of the new Covenant.</p>
            <p>As for Circumciſion, it was not neceſſary for all that were circumciſed, to believe and repent, or to have faith in Chriſt, or to be converted and made Diſciples by preaching, as neceſſary Qualifications to partake of the Ordinances. But the inſtitution in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.13. ſaith, <hi>All born in thy houſe, or bought with thy money;</hi> though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo ignorant, carnal, or have never ſo wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed parents or parentage, yet ſuch ought to be circumciſed, this inſtitution running upon that family.</p>
            <p>But baptiſm is a confirmation of our Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration already wrought in us, and our new birth, and our union with Jeſus Chriſt by faith, and therefore belongs only to them, where this Regeneration is, to them that are born again of Water, and of the Spirit, and ſo the Paſſeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was to be partaken of by the carnal <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elite</hi> after the fleſh, <hi>viz.</hi> the captive, the ſlave bought with money, Heathen, Black <hi>Moor,</hi> or of the <hi>Canaanites;</hi> but the Lords Supper only belongs to Diſciples able to diſcern the Lords body by faith, without the which they bring Judgement upon themſelves, and make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves guilty of the body and blood of the Lord, except they are able to examine themſelves,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:42909:77"/>
               <hi>Let a man examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat of that Bread, and drink of that Cap.</hi> So that which the Apoſtle drives at in this chapter, is this principally, that as the temporal <hi>Iſrael</hi> who were the Church of God then privileged in that temporal Covenant upon their falls and ſins, were by God viſited and corrected, to ſhew to all the world, that he would not countenance ſin in them, without ſad reproof, ſo he concludes in this alſo, the Goſpel-Church profeſſing the covenant of grace, and enjoying the privileges thereof, they ſhould not eſcape if they turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide from God, and ſin againſt him without checks, reproofs and ſad admonitions from him, and here lies the ſcope; and the rather might ſuch caution be given to Goſpel churches, becauſe they were in a covenant of Grace onely by a viſible profeſſion, and therefore may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly receive the greater danger by ſin if their profeſſion ſhould not be right and ſaving.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome may object, <hi>That there were ſome precious Saints then in the Old Testament, and do you think that they did not perform the Ordinances with ſpiritual hearts?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No queſtion ſuch did, as it is ſaid of Abel, <hi>By faith he offered a more excellent ſacrifice than</hi> Cain.</p>
            <p>Duties performed from faith with an eye to Chriſt were then acceptable, when ſo performed, though ceremoniouſly, and ſuch duties relating meerly to the covenant of works.</p>
            <p>Only I would have you to obſerve, that the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:42909:78"/>
carnal <hi>Iſraelite</hi> was without faith capable to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form every ceremonial Law,<note place="margin">Faith made not <hi>Iſraelite</hi> capable of performing the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Law.</note> required by the old covenant according to the expreſs tenor thereof, as truly as the believer.</p>
            <p>So in no wiſe can it be ſaid of the duties rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the new covenant, either then or now; as repentance, ſpiritual prayer, thankſgiving, and divers other duties perpetually at all times, and univerſall to all Saints: I deny that the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <hi>Jews</hi> were capable of the true performance of theſe, I mean as to anſwer the Rules or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions given. For if you look to the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm in the Common Prayer Book, you ſhall find that it was a maxim, received by all that own that Liturgy, That no leſs than a profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of faith and repentance, was required of them that were baptized.</p>
            <p>Whence obſerve, they thereby confirm the doctrine that I have been all this while pleading for, that none but ſuch as have Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance in their hearts, and do profeſs the fame ſhould be baptized.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But may ſome ſay, <hi>Did not ſome bring their freinds to Christ to be healed, and Chriſt ſeeing the faith of thoſe which brought them healed them? And if they believed for others, to the healing of their bodies, why not alſo then for the ſaving of their ſouls?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is directly the Papiſts Argument, with which ſome do cloſe rather than part with their Idol. But to ſpeak to this more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, There is nothing more plain, than that God
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:42909:78"/>
did give gifts of healing to many, as that the faith of one contributed to the healing of the body of another, as their Servants and children, as in the caſe of the Centurion, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.7, 8, 9. verſes, and <hi>Jairus the Ruler over the Synagogue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this is no way to prove that one man ſhould come to have union with Chriſt, and ſo to have juſtification and eternal life by the faith of another.</p>
            <p>For in this caſe the Prophet ſaith, The juſt ſhall live by his faith, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.17. And he that believes not is condemned already, that is, every individual he that believes not, ſhall be condemned, and he that believeth ſhall be ſaved, but ſome do bring in that text in the 7. of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that <hi>Levi</hi> paid tyths in <hi>Abraham,</hi> therefore why ſhould not ſouls believe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in their believing Parents, as well as <hi>Levi</hi> paid tythes in his believing Father <hi>Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It ſeems to me, that this Act of <hi>Abraham</hi> was performed as a publique perſon, in his paying Tythes to <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> herein repreſenting his Poſterity; but not ſo in all the reſt of his Acts; It doth not follow, that he believed and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for all his poſterity: for this were a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ground indeed for Papiſts implicite Faith.</p>
            <p>We know that <hi>Adam</hi> in his fall, did act ſin as a publique perſon, in which all mankind are ſaid to ſin, <hi>Romans</hi> 5. But it doth not follow, that all the future <hi>Acts</hi> that <hi>Adam</hi> committed, he did perform as a publique perſon, for if all the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity of a believing perſon ſo many generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:42909:79"/>
to come, as <hi>Levy</hi> from <hi>Abraham;</hi> did believe and repent in their believing parents; then there is no ground to oppoſe, that all the world at this day are believers, becauſe they were all in the line of believing <hi>Noah,</hi> he being the father from whence all the world did proceed that are now living this day.</p>
            <p>And again obſerve, that if the Covenant of life belongs to all believers ſeed, then we need not want for Church-members; becauſe all the world are the children and off-ſpring of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Noah,</hi> and this argument carries the right of Covenant to all the world, being the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of a Believer, <hi>viz. Noah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">An anſwer to that text <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.13.</note>Further, ſome bring that in <hi>Matthew</hi> 19.13. <hi>There were brought unto him little children that he ſhould put his hand upon them and pray, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples rebuked them, and Jeſus ſaid, ſuffer little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and forbid them not to come to me, for of ſuch is the kingdom of God; and he laid his hands on them and departed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Mark</hi> 10.13. thus, <hi>And they brought young Children to him, that he ſhould touch them, and his Diſciples rebuked them that brought them, but when Jeſus ſaw it, he was much diſpleaſed, and ſaid unto them, Suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not, for of ſuch is the kingdom of God; verily I ſay unto you, whoſoever ſhall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Kingdom of God as a little child, ſhall not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter therein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence would ſome maintain a covenant of eternal life in the fleſh, for that end they bring
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:42909:79"/>
this Text, but let us examine what the meaning of it may be.</p>
            <p>Firſt, whoſe children they were, that were brought to Chriſt, doth not appear, its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable they were the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but what their mediate parents, whether believers or wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked perſons doth not appear certainly, but by the former diſcourſe in the chapter, it ſhould ſeem they might be wicked and ungodly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, for there were ſuch mentioned before that tempted Chriſt, and aſked him queſtions.</p>
            <p>The next thing is, for what did they bring theſe children unto Chriſt? moſt certain not to baptize them, becauſe Chriſt it is ſaid, baptized not, but the Diſciples, <hi>John</hi> 4.2. What then were they brought to Chriſt for? One Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt ſaith, <hi>He took them in his arms and bleſſed them,</hi> another ſaith, <hi>He laid his hands on them and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All which conſidered (in my judgement) it doth probably appear, they were brought to him to be healed of ſome diſeaſe, it being uſual in thoſe daies that by prayer and laying on of hands, they did heal the ſick.</p>
            <p>But the main expreſſion in the Text, to be noted, is this, <hi>That of ſuch are the Kingdom of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From theſe words ſome gather, that all the children of believing parents, do belong to the kingdom of God, and if to the Kingdom of God, then to all the privileges of that kingdom.</p>
            <p>But (as you have heard) it will be very doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:42909:80"/>
whether theſe children, had any believing parents to the fifth or ſixth degree, for of ſuch is the Kingdom of God, ſaith the Text, the which we muſt underſtand thus; That all the children born of the body of Believers, and that when little ones in arms, do belong to the kingdom of God, if you will make this text to countenance that error of the covenant in the fleſh, the which is erroneous, as appears, in that the greateſt number of believers chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, never belonged in that ſenſe to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, for <hi>Adam</hi> had a <hi>Cain</hi> as well as an <hi>Abel, Noah</hi> had a <hi>Ham</hi> as well as a <hi>Sem, Abraham</hi> had an <hi>Iſhmael</hi> as well as an <hi>Iſaac, Iſaac</hi> had an <hi>Eſau</hi> as well as a <hi>Jacob.</hi> And ſo I might menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all the Scriptures, wherein in like manner God doth as well bring forth the generation of the wicked out of the godly, and the generation of the elect, out of the line of the wicked, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely.</p>
            <p>But if by Kingdom of God, be meant that condition or ſtate, that men are intereſſed in, by virtue of a Covenant of eternal life, and that believers children ſhould by birth and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration belong to it, then this fully croſſeth that doctrine of Chriſt to <hi>Nicodemus, Joh.</hi> 3.5. as was formerly ſpoken to.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome may ſay, <hi>Its poſſible that ſuch a little child may believe, becauſe in</hi> Matthew 18. 3, 4, 5, 6. verſes, <hi>it is ſaid, We ſhould not offend ſuch little ones that believe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you grant that ſome children, when little
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:42909:80"/>
do believe, and therefore belong to the kingdom of God, to that I aſſent, let them be whoſe children they will, whether of Believers or Infidels.</p>
            <p>If they believe they are in Chriſt, and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed in the Kingdom of God.</p>
            <p>But what makes this, for the covenant in the fleſh of carnal unbelieving ſeed?</p>
            <p>Again, If by Kingdom of God ſhould be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> ſtate or Church, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren here underſtood for children of that <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> nation; then in that ſenſe it is true, that all the children born in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church by virtue of their birth in that family or nation belonged as members to that National Church, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed in the Covenant of Circumciſion, which was the national covenant, and the privileges of the ſame, and were by natural birth intereſſed therein.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> But the true and proper meaning of the Text appears plain to be here in <hi>Mark</hi> 10.13, 14, 15. compared together, for when he had in the 14. verſe ſaid, <hi>Of ſuch belongeth the Kingdom of God</hi> in verſe the 15. he preſently ſaith, <hi>Verily I ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, whoſoever receiveth not the kingdom of God, as a little child, ſhall not enter therein,</hi> this I ſay interprets theſe words before, <hi>Of ſuch as the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God;</hi> that is, of ſuch like in grace, as theſe be by nature, ſuch ſouls that are by Gods grace, ſubdued and brought into a child-like frame of ſpirit, they only are ſuch as are of the kingdom of God, as for example.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:42909:81"/>When the Diſciples reaſoned who ſhould be greateſt among them, Chriſt ſet a little child as a patern of humility, innocency, and harmleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>And alſo ſaith the Apoſtle, Be you children in malice, and old men in underſtanding, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. and ſaith <hi>Peter, As new born babes deſire the ſincere Milk of the word, that ye might grow thereby</hi> 1 Pet. 2.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>And ſo as there is a parity held forth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a man and his wife, and Chriſt and his Church, ſo in Scripture there is, between a child in nature, and a child in grace, as the natural begetting, the ſpiritual begetting, alluding to that, there is the natural birth and the ſpiritual birth held forth, by that ſucking of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers breaſt, and by ſucking of the breaſt of Gods word.</p>
            <p>A little babe we know in nature will truſt to his parents, ſo the new born babe will truſt in Chriſt; if the natural babe want any thing it will go to its parents and ask them for it, ſo muſt a new born Babe make his requeſt known to God in all his Wants; If any thing hurt a babe, he will cry, and make his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint to his Father; So the child of God, if any ſtreight oppreſſeth him, he cries to God his Father; The natural child, will imitate his Father and his Brethren, ſo the new born babe imitates God the Father and Chriſt, and the reſt (as it were) of his brethren; the new born babe when young, a little will content it, ſo
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:42909:81"/>
ſhould the new born babe in grace, be in all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions and ſtates content.</p>
            <p>And this I underſtand, to be the proper meaning of this place, <hi>Of ſuch is the Kingdome of God,</hi> that is, of ſuch ſouls, that are ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually qualified by Gods grace, anſwerable to little children in nature, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.1. to 6. of ſuch godly new born heavenly babes, is the kingdom of God.</p>
            <p>And this Expoſition agrees with the right ſcope of the place, and the true analogy of Faith.</p>
            <p>And therefore I would have you ſeriouſly to conſider, that this covenant of grace in the fleſh, the whole word of the Lord diſclaims it, and will give no countenance to any ſuch notion, ſo deſtructive in its conſequence, to the truth of God (as you have heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome may object and ſay, <hi>But this which you call a Covenant of Works, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Temporal promiſes, and alſo Laws and Statutes, you are not to underſtand that to be a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct covenant from the Covenant of eternal life, but a form of Adminiſtration, that the Covenant of Grace was then adminiſtred in. And the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal children were not then intereſſed in the main privileges of the Covenant, as Adoption and Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, but the outward promiſes and privileges only made to their Fathers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I know this objection ſome do bring,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:42909:82"/>
which if it be well weighed, is inconſiſtent with their own arguments.</p>
            <p>For if this objection be true, then was there no covenant made to <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, but onely an adminiſtration of a Covenant. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ill do they affirm, that the covenant was made to them, therefore the adminiſtration. But this doubtleſs is falſe, and this objection (as I ſaid) is falſe and groundleſs, as appears by ſeveral expreſs teſtimonies in Scripture which doth evidently prove two diſtinct covenants, as for example.</p>
            <p>Saith God in <hi>Geneſis</hi> chap. 17. and verſe 7. <hi>And I will eſtabliſh my Covenant between me and thee, and thy ſeed after thee in their Generations, for an everlaſting Covenant, to be a God to thee, and to thy ſeed after thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where obſerve, that the Lord doth not ſay, that he will eſtabliſh an adminiſtration of the Covenant, with his ſeed in their generations, but his covenant, and <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed, muſt keep his covenant; and in verſe the 13. this my covenant, ſhall be in your fleſh, for an everlaſting Covenant, not this adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my Covenant, ſhall be in your fleſh; and ſo in <hi>Hebr.</hi> the 8.6, 7, 8, 9, verſes. <hi>But now hath he obtained a more excellent Miniſtery, by how much alſo he is the Mediator of a better Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, which is establiſhed upon better promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mark, (as I have before ſhewed at large) here
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:42909:82"/>
were two covenants, the one upon better promiſes, the other upon worſe promiſes; which muſt needs be underſtood temporal bleſſings, and deliverances, and privileges; Therefore he ſaith, they ſerve unto the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and ſhadow of heavenly things; and in verſe the ſeventh, if that firſt Teſtament had been faultleſs, there ſhould have been no place ſought for the ſecond. And in the nineth verſe he ſaith, that the old covenant they continued not in, therefore God regarded them not; and in verſe the 12. in that he ſaith, a new cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, he hath made the firſt old. Now that which decayeth, and waketh old, is ready to vaniſh away; which Scriptures do evidence as clear as the Sun at Noon day, that there was a real covenant made with the <hi>Jews,</hi> made before with <hi>Abraham,</hi> but committed to the Church in writing by <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he led them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and this Covenant they brake, ſaid <hi>Jeremy</hi> chap. 31.32. and here the Apoſtle ſaith, they continued not in it, and the laſt verſe ſaith, it was made old, and therefore vaniſhing away; and in <hi>Hebrews</hi> 9. there the Apoſtle calls this old covenant, that contained in it ſhadows and paterns of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things, the firſt Teſtament wherein the Apoſtle in verſe 17. and forwards, doth ſhew there were two Teſtaments, the one confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the blood of Bulls, the other confirmed by the blood of Chriſt. And if this were not
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:42909:83"/>
true, then moſt falſly do ſuch affirm, the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was made with <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, therefore the privileges, if <hi>Abraham</hi> lineally had no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant made with them, but only an external and outward Adminiſtration and Privilege, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Upon that ground there was no national Covenant at all made with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but only an outward adminiſtration, and that being gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be Ceremonial, except you can prove another Ceremonial adminiſtration as carnal, as that adminiſtration was, now in force, there is not the like ground why carnal and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing children ſhould have any ſhare in it.</p>
            <p>But that there were two covenants is moſt evident,<note place="margin">An Expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that text, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.21. &amp;c.</note> as appears in the New Teſtament, as I have formerly at large endeavoured to make good, only I ſhall add that in <hi>Gallatians</hi> 4.21. and forward, where ſaith the Apoſtle, Tell me, ye that would be under the Law, do ye not hear the Law, for it is written, That <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> had two ſons, the one by a bond-maid, the other by a free-woman, but he who was of the bond-woman, was born after the fleſh, but he of the free-woman was by promiſe; which things are an allegory, that is, by theſe things, other things are meant.</p>
            <p>For theſe are the two Covenants, the one from Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> which gendereth to bondage, which is <hi>Agar,</hi> for this <hi>Agar</hi> is Mount <hi>Sinai</hi>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:42909:83"/>
in <hi>Arabia,</hi> and anſwereth to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that now is, and is in bondage with her children, but <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which is above is free, which is the Mother of us all.</p>
            <p>Now we Brethren as <hi>Iſaac</hi> was, are children of the promiſe, but as then, he that was born after the fleſh, perſecuted him that was born after the Spirit; ſo it is now, notwithſtanding caſt out the bond-woman and her ſon, for the Son of the bond-woman ſhall not be heir with the ſon of the free-woman; So then Brethren, we are not children of the bond-woman, but of the free. And in the next chapter he ſaith, <hi>Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made you free, and be not intangle again, with the yoak of bondage,</hi> which he afterwards explains to be the Covenant of Circumciſion <hi>Gall.</hi> 5.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, 2, 3.</p>
            <p>But to ſpeak ſomething to this text, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> here by the Apoſtle, is underſtood to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent God by way of type and figure, as it were, his two women <hi>Sarah</hi> and <hi>Hagar,</hi> the two covenants of God; the two ſons, <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> repreſents (as the text hints) the two ſeeds in theſe two covenants of God. Now <hi>Sarah</hi> the free-woman, repreſents the covenant of grace, and <hi>Hagar</hi> the covenant of Works; both theſe women continued in <hi>Abrahams</hi> houſe together for a time, the firſt child he begat by the ſtrength of nature, without faith in a promiſe, of a bond-woman: The other he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:42909:84"/>
by faith, in a promiſe without ſtrength of nature, of a free-woman; and the free-woman continued in <hi>Abrahams</hi> houſe with the bond-woman and her ſon without any Scruple, till <hi>Iſaac</hi> was born and alſo weaned. And when the ſon of the bond-woman perſecuted <hi>Iſaac,</hi> the free-woman teſtifyes againſt the bond-wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and her ſon, and will have them no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to abide in the houſe with her ſon; <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> likewiſe had firſt the free-woman, and the laſt the bond-woman. The free-woman was ſometime barren in <hi>Abrahams</hi> houſe, but the bond-woman was fruitfull.</p>
            <p>Now the myſtery that the Apoſtle hints to be held forth in this Hiſtory is clear, from which he ſpeaks in this 4. of the <hi>Gallatians</hi> which muſt be this.</p>
            <p>That God in like manner firſt made a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, even as <hi>Abraham</hi> firſt had a free-woman, which covenant (in a great meaſure) was barren, bringing forth no ſeed, or elſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally barren as <hi>Sarah</hi> was, in reſpect of that ſubſtantial ſeed Chriſt Jeſus, which <hi>Iſaac</hi> ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped forth, as ſoon as God had made this cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, he in the ſame houſe or Church hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a <hi>Hagar,</hi> that is a Covenant of works, in which God hath abundance of ſeed, becoming his by ſtrength of nature, without faith in a promiſe, and the Covenant of grace as <hi>Sarah</hi> (in a ſenſe) becomes barren. All which time the covenant of grace and covenant of works
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:42909:84"/>
both agree very well to be in Gods houſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but at the laſt, as the free-woman brought forth <hi>Iſaac,</hi> ſo the covenant of Grace brings forth Chriſt Jeſus without ſtrength of nature, by faith in a promiſe, as in <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.35. and when this ſubſtantial ſeed is come, then the covenant of grace and works remain in Gods Church together: but afterwards when Chriſt the true <hi>Iſaac</hi> was (as it were) weaned, that is, come to maturity, ſo as to appear, that he was now in the office of the Miniſtery, the Scribes and Phariſees with the high Prieſts, all the ſons of <hi>Hagar,</hi> the old covenant, perſecuted Chriſt, and thoſe in him.</p>
            <p>Whereupon the free-woman, or rather the free Covenant of grace, doth teſtify, that a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works with her ſeed, ſhall no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger remain with her in the Church of God.</p>
            <p>But now the free covenant and her ſons, that is, the Covenant of grace only, and her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren born by faith in a promiſe, onely muſt for a time forward remain in the houſe of God.</p>
            <p>So that now rejoice thou barren that bareſt not, the Covenant of grace becomes fruitfull, having ſeed in all nations, therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which is above, which is free, is the Mother of us all, and thoſe <hi>us</hi> or <hi>we,</hi> that were members of the primitive Church, were born from above by faith in a promiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:42909:85"/>Therefore it is plain from hence, that there were no carnal babes in that Church. But when Chriſt, the true ſeed of the Covenant, was perſecuted by the <hi>Jews,</hi> which were the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the covenant of Works, the Goſpel doth plentifully teſtifie the aboliſhing the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works, and the caſting forth of thoſe bond-children out of Gods Church, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.45, 46. <hi>But when the</hi> Jews <hi>ſaw the multitude they were filled with envy, and ſpake against thoſe things which were ſpoken by</hi> Paul, <hi>contradicting and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming. Then</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Barnabas <hi>waxed bold and ſaid, It was neceſſary that the word of God ſhould firſt have been ſpoken to you, but ſeeing ye put it far from you, and judge your ſelves unworthy of everlaſting life, lo we turn to the Gentiles; for ſo hath the Lord commanded us.</hi> And as appears in the 11. chap. of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and as that 4. chap. of <hi>Gall.</hi> in expreſs words ſaith in the 25. verſe, this <hi>Hagar</hi> is meant Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> in <hi>Arabia,</hi> and anſwereth to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that now is, and is in bondage with her children; this being ſo clear that the bond-woman, and her ſon, that is to ſay, the covenant af works, and all thoſe rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>Abraham</hi> only in a covenant of works, are caſt out of the houſe of God.</p>
            <p>How oppoſite then is their opinion to the truth, that ſtill would have a fleſhly generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be in the houſe of God with their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
            <p>But ſeeing the natural branches that truly
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:42909:85"/>
were deſcended of the Line of faithfull <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> might not have that honor; How much leſs the unbelieving ſeed of the Gentiles that are wild by nature.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee in brief this objection anſwered, and that there is no ground for childrens bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, but an imagination, through thick dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, upon the minds of people, they ſetting up this idol in their hearts, God hath anſwered them accordingly as the Prophet ſpeaks in <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel</hi> 14.2, 3, 4, 5. verſes, <hi>And the word of the Lord came unto me, ſaying,, Son of man, theſe men have ſet up their idols in their heart, and put their ſtumbling block of their iniquity before their face, ſhould I be inquired of at all by them? therefore ſpeak unto them, thus ſaith the Lord, Every man of the houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>that ſetteth up his Idols in his heart, and putteth the ſtumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and commeth to the Prophet, I the Lord will anſwer him that commeth, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Multitude of his Idols, that I may take the houſe of</hi> Iſrael <hi>in their own heart, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are all eſtranged from me through their Idols.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where you ſee, that when ſouls ſet up an i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dol in their heart, God doth anſwer them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their idol, as he hath in this caſe ſuffering blind blindnes and uncertainty of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to befall them.</p>
            <p>For ſuch as defend childrens baptiſm, and the ableſt I have met with, do grant they have no command or example in the New Teſtament for
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:42909:86"/>
their practice, but ground the ſame on a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, which you have heard evidently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, is drawn from an error; For to affirm or maintain, that the covenant of eternal life, is made with believers carnal ſeed, is a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous error, and therefore the conſequence muſt needs be as falſe and rotten as that error from whence it is drawn, then judge you what a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful conſequence that muſt be.</p>
            <p>Take the whole reſult thus, Childrens bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, hath no ground from the word of God, either Command or Example for it, but a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence (as before) ſo that it is meerly a tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men, ſetting up in the place and room of the Commands of God, to wit, baptizing of Believers. This groundleſs tradition, which makes void the commandment of God, even as the wicked <hi>Jews</hi> did in <hi>Mark</hi> 7.7. <hi>Howbeit, in vain ſaith the Lord they worſhip me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men,</hi> and in verſe 9. <hi>He ſaid unto them, Full well you reject or fruſtrate the commandments of God, that you may keep your own Traditions:</hi> and in verſe 13. <hi>Make the word of God of none effect through your traditions which you have delivered, and many ſuch things do you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now beloved, this is the very ſin of ſuch as defend this tradition, they thereby make void and fruſtrate the Commandment of God; where Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Repent and be baptized every one of you,</hi> that is, every one that repents; and ſaith <hi>Annanias</hi> to <hi>Paul, Ariſe now, why tarrieſt thou, and be baptized for the waſhing away of thy ſins;</hi> and
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:42909:86"/>
               <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Cornelius</hi> his family, he there commands them to be baptiſed in the name of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.48. Thoſe and many more ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing commands of the New Teſtament that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to believers and penitent perſons are fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate and made void by chriſtening children.</p>
            <p>Thus poor ſouls are nurſed up in a habit of diſreſpect and diſobedience to theſe command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, becauſe this invention takes the place and room of the ſame.</p>
            <p>Do but conſider how dangerous a ſin this practice is, it is ſetting up a ſuperſtitious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention in the room of Gods command in his worſhip.</p>
            <p>Now God and his Commandments, muſt not be ſeparated; for a ſoul that rightly ſets up Gods Commandments ſets up and exalts God, and to ſet up any worſhip in the room of what is commanded of God, is in effect to ſet up a falſe God.</p>
            <p>Do but ſee what ſad Witneſſes God hath given from heaven againſt this ſin in <hi>Leviticus chap.</hi> 10.1, 2. where <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> offered ſtrange fire to God, as the text ſaith, which he commanded not, for which God burned them with fire from heaven; the Lord doth not ſay which he had forbidden, but which he commanded not. Many ſouls ask where God hath forbid this practice of childrens baptiſm, therefore I would prove by theſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures that things or perſons in the worſhip of God in room of what God commands, are abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:42909:87"/>
to God. Hear how God doth threaten a people for this ſin in <hi>Jerem.</hi> 9.13, 14, 15. <hi>And the Lord ſaid, Becauſe they had forſaken my Law which I had ſet before them, and have not obeyed my voice, nor walked therein, but have walked after the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of their own hearts,</hi> therefore he ſaith in verſe 15. <hi>He will give them to feed on Worm-wood, and give them Water of Gall to drink, and will conſume them.</hi> Now this is the very caſe of ſuch as ſet up this tradition, they forſake the Law of believers baptiſm ſet before them, and have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver obeyed his voice nor walked therein; but have walked in childrens ſprinkling, which the imagination of their own hearts have deviſed. This Text is very much applicable to ſuch ſouls: the like evil wicked <hi>Saul</hi> is ſaid to do, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.12, 13. verſes, for which God rends the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from him, and in <hi>Jeremy</hi> 8.9. <hi>The wiſemen are diſmayed and aſhamed, lo, they have rejected the word of the Lord, and what wiſdom is in them? there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will I give their wives to others, and their fields to them that ſhall inherit them:</hi> And ſo in <hi>Jeremy</hi> 7.31. <hi>They have built the High places of</hi> Tophet, <hi>which is in the valley of the Son of</hi> Hinnom, <hi>to burn their Sons and Daughters in the fire, which I commanded them not, neither came it in my heart:</hi> upon which he threatens deſtruction upon them.</p>
            <p>And you ſee how God made a breach upon <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah</hi> for touching the Ark, God not comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him, or giving him rule for ſuch practice; God having given a command to the Prieſts on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:42909:87"/>
to do that work, but not to him: So God hath given a command and example to baptize belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers only, and not children, therefore it is the ſin of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah,</hi> and likewiſe the ſin of King <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>z<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.14, 15. where you ſee the ſad judgement of God upon <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah</hi> for doing that in the worſhip of God, which God had not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, in the room or ſtead of what he had commanded, God ſtruct him with Leproſie, and that in his forehead, and the hand of God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted him, as an admonition to perſons that now dare adventure upon the like ſinful pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, to offer any thing to God, as religious worſhip, which he hath not commanded, inſtead of what he hath commanded; the Lord in this caſe ſets out himſelf to be a jealous God, that will viſit the ſins of the father upon the children to the third and fourth generation, of ſuch as make to themſelves any graven Image, that is, any form by which we will worſhip God; be ſure it is of Gods own making, for we muſt not make it to our ſelves; the Lord doth call in Scripture ſuch like worſhip, which men do in the room of Gods commanded worſhip. <hi>The Worſhip of Devils;</hi> I ſhall give you one inſtance for this in Scripture, as in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 106.35, 36. and they ſerved their i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols which were a ſnare unto them, yea they ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed their ſons and their daughters unto De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, and the next verſe expounding himſelf, it is ſaid, they offered them unto the Idols of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in like maner, do not men bring their Sons
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:42909:88"/>
and their Daughters in this caſe, and offer them to this invention of ſprinkling.</p>
            <p>You have for baptizing of believers the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of Chriſt, and teſtimony of the infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Pen-men, and all men in the world owning the Scriptures to be the word of God, to be of the Lords own inſtitution, but this practice of childrens ſprinkling, God hath raiſed up in all ages ſome, that have profeſſed Religion, to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt it, and a great part of thoſe that have the power of godlyneſs do renounce it, as a ſinful practice, and that upon ſubſtantial grounds. And me thinks when you conſider that your Childrens ſprinkling, hath no command or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in the Goſpel to confirm it, and only ſuch a conſequence, that flows from an error.</p>
            <p>I hope ſuch as fear God will take heed how they harden their hearts, in the practice of ſo hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous a ſin, and in the neglect of ſo ſolemn a duty as the Ordinance of Dipping Believers, in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt; for is there any man able to declare from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that ever any ſolemn Ordinance of ſtanding uſe in the Church of the New Teſtament, had for its inſtitution, any leſs than a command of God, and a promiſe of bleſſing to the faithfull performance of the ſame; But there is for childrens baptiſm nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther command to inſtitute, nor any promiſe to bleſs, but rather indeed, the performers of that worſhip, may expect a curſe, and not a bleſſing in the performance of the ſame, as you have it
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:42909:88"/>
in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 99.8. <hi>Thou anſwerest them O Lord our God, thou art a God that forgaveſt them, though thou too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest vengeance of their inventions,</hi> with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.29. Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions, and the plague broke in upon them, as it did in the 2 <hi>Chron</hi> 26.19, 20, 21. <hi>Then</hi> Uzzi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah <hi>was wroth, and had a Cenſor in his hand, to burn Incenſe, and while he was wroth with the Priests, the Leproſy roſe up in his forehead, before the Prieſts in the houſe of the Lord; from beſides the incenſe Altar, and</hi> Azariah <hi>the chief Priest, and all the reſt of the Priests looked upon him, and behold, he was leprous in his fore-head, and they thruſt him out from thence, yea himſelf hasted to go out, becauſe the Lord had ſmitten him. And</hi> Uzziah <hi>the King, was a Leper to the day of his death, and dwelt in a ſeveral houſe, for he was out off from the houſe of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you ſee the ſad curſe of God, executed againſt ſuch like inventions in the ſervice of God that men ſet up in the room of Gods commands, thereby juſtling out his Commands, as the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſaith.</p>
            <p>This is for a man to ſet up his Poſts by Gods Poſts, and in a ſenſe, ſetting up himſelf in the place and room of God, and flowes from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Pride; as here it is ſaid of King <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah,</hi> preceding this his ſin, his heart was lifted up to his own deſtruction.</p>
            <p>Now moſt certain it is, That man <hi>Moſes,</hi> was faithful in all Gods houſe as a ſervant in giving the Church then, exact and perfect rules, how
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:42909:89"/>
they ſhould ſerve God, unto which they muſt not ad, and from which they muſt not detract nor take away, <hi>Diut.</hi> 4.2. ſo Chriſt is every way as faithful over his houſe as a Lord, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.4, 5, 6. and rightly to this purpoſe is applyed that in <hi>Col.</hi> 2.8. with 20, 21, 22.</p>
            <p>For men to imbrace any worſhip to their God that they have not a rule for, it is in that chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter condemned, as will-worſhip, and traditions of men; and warily conſider that it foſters men in a ſinfull neglect of that holy and ſolemn Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Dipping believers.</p>
            <p>Do not all our Proteſtant Authors in all their Diſputations againſt the Papiſts, defend that Faith and Repentance precede Baptiſm, thereby confuting the Papiſts, that Baptiſm is not to convey grace where it is not, but to confirm Grace, and ſtrengthen it where it is? and in that Catechiſm imbraced generally by all Proteſtants in the Common Liturgy in <hi>England,</hi> this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being demanded, <hi>What is required of them that are to be baptized?</hi> The anſwer is, <hi>Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance;</hi> which doth plainly manifeſt, that it was the judgement of all thoſe that were Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, owning that Liturgy, that none ought to be baptized, but ſuch as repent and believe, not only ſo, but that do confeſs faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, becauſe in Baptiſm there is, as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>The anſwer of a good conſcience,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.19. compared with <hi>Philip</hi> and the Eunuch, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.38: <hi>If thou believeſt with all thy heart thou mayeſt?</hi> Saith the Eunuch, <hi>I believe that Jeſus Christ is the Son of
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:42909:89"/>
God.</hi> So in <hi>Acts</hi> 19. it is ſaid, <hi>They came to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle confeſſing their deads.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now conſider that this doctrine in all thoſe times was defended, that faith and repentance, muſt needs precede baptiſm, why? becauſe they concluded it a ſeal of the new Covenant, and therefore where perſons were not in a Covenant by Faith, did in appoſition to the Papiſts defend, they had no intereſt in baptiſm.</p>
            <p>Now let any ſoul that is not blinded with the ſubtilty of Satan, and by means of the ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling block of iniquity, ſet up in his own heart, as ſaith the Lord in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 14.4. Let ſuch I ſay judge, how croſs to this Doctrine they do pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, that do baptize, viſible graceleſs and Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs children, ſo far as any man is able to judge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome will ſay, I grant this, bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of children, is a meer tradition, and that not to be practiſed by Chriſtians, and I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in the primitive time, Believers only had this Ordinance diſpeneſd upon them: but I do conceive (ſaith the Soul) I have received the baptiſm of the Holy Ghoſt, therefore I need not that Ordinance of Baptiſm by Water, and the rather, becauſe I think that was <hi>Johns</hi> bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and the baptiſm of the Holy Ghoſt being come, hath put an end to that Baptiſm of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Then you deny in Judgement any Ordinance of Baptiſm at all, to ſtand in force, which is be ſure an upſtart opinion, exceeding
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:42909:90"/>
croſs, to the Doctrine of Chriſt in his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; but let me as warily as I can, anſwer this queſtion.</p>
            <p>Firſt you do think it was <hi>Johns</hi> baptiſm, it is true, that <hi>John</hi> baptized or dipped into Water, thoſe that came to him confeſſing their ſins, and profeſſing faith in him, that ſhould come after him.</p>
            <p>But though it is true, <hi>Johns</hi> baptiſm in this reſpect, pointing out Chriſt to come, is done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, yet it is as true, that the Lord hath afreſh, ſince his death and reſurrection, intituled this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of dipping believers into Chriſt already come and fully exhibited in the fleſh, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19, 20. with <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.16. and <hi>Peter</hi> after, the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ghoſt was in that extraordinary manner pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red down upon him according to <hi>Johns</hi> Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, to wit, with cloven fiery tongues, he doth after this, by the direction of the infallible Spirit, command all his converts that were prickt in the heart, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38. to repent and be baptized every one of them for the remiſſion of ſins, and they ſhould receive the gift of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ghoſt.</p>
            <p>Where you may ſee, that this was baptiſm of Water; that he commanded all that repent to ſubmit to, becauſe the Holy Ghoſt, as thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary gifts was to follow, to wit, thoſe gifts that <hi>Joel</hi> propheſied of. And ſo in <hi>Acts</hi> 10. When <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his houſe had heard the word of God, the Holy Ghoſt fell upon them, and as an
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:42909:90"/>
effect thereof, they ſpake with new tongues, and magnified God. <hi>And then ſaith</hi> Peter <hi>to them of the Circumciſion, How ſhould we forbid water that theſe ſhould not be baptized which have received the Holy Ghoſt as well as we.</hi> So that this great Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle was ſo far from this opinion, that he urgeth the contrary, that becauſe they had received the Holy Ghoſt, and that in the extraordinary gifts, thereof, which <hi>John</hi> foretold, Chriſt ſhould bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize them with, ſaith he, How ſhall we forbid water; plainly holding forth,, that it is baptiſm by water that he here is ſpeaking of, and in which verſe 48. he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jeſus, becauſe they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Holy Ghoſt, therefore they muſt not be denyed that Ordinance of baptiſm by Water, clearly holding forth, that the enjoying the Holy Ghoſt, was ſo far from being an argument why ſouls ſhould not be baptized with water, that it is an argument, that they ought to be baptized more eſpecially; and this appears in <hi>Paul</hi> after his converſion, which I underſtand, was wrought by Chriſt immediately.</p>
            <p>For ſaith he to <hi>Annanias, Behold he is a choſen veſſel to me, for he now prayeth,</hi> therefore ſay I he was now converted, as to the inward work of faith, changing his heart; <hi>But when</hi> Annanias <hi>came to him, he laid his hands upon him:</hi> and there were two effects of this, his laying on of his hands <hi>He received his ſight, and was filled with the Holy Ghoſt and he aroſe forthwith and was baptized,</hi> that is to ſay, after he was filled with the Holy Ghoſt he
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:42909:91"/>
aroſe and was baptized in water, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.17, 18. compared with <hi>Acts</hi> 22.16. When <hi>Paul</hi> had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Annanias</hi> ſaith, <hi>And now</hi> Paul <hi>why tarriest thou? Ariſe and be baptized, for the waſhing away of thy ſins, calling upon the name of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Obſerve that <hi>Annanias</hi> had an immediate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary commiſſion from Chriſt by viſion, to come with the meſſage to <hi>Paul,</hi> and Chriſt in a viſion bids <hi>Paul</hi> go to <hi>Annanias</hi> and he ſhould tell him what he ſhould do, and <hi>Annanias</hi> according to that Commiſſion of Chriſt upon his being fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the holy Ghoſt, commands him to be baptized. And this agrees with the Covenant of grace in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 36.27. where the Lord ſaith, <hi>I will put my Spirit in them, and cauſe them to walk in my way,</hi> and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.19. I will give them one heart, and will put my Spirit within them, and will take the ſtony heart out of their fleſh, and will give them an heart of fleſh, that they may walk in my Statutes, and keep mine Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances to do them, and they ſhall be my people, and I will be their God.</p>
            <p>Where you may ſee, that God is ſo far from giving his Spirit, to the end that ſouls ſhould plead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by freedom from the practice of thoſe comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Ordinances of Chriſt, that on the contrary, it is the end why God gives his Spirit to enable, and to cauſe them to walk in his way, and in his Ordinances, and in particular baptiſm.</p>
            <p>And obſerve, the Apoſtles have not left us a bare example only, that they did baptize after that
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:42909:91"/>
Chriſt powred out the Holy Ghoſt, and that by the authority received from heaven, but doth command it, as you have heard to all that repent and believe, and to all that receive the holy Ghoſt to ſubmit to it.</p>
            <p>But again, the Baptiſm of the Holy Ghoſt, and fire, that <hi>John</hi> foretold of, it is clear, was extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily given upon an eſpecial ground and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon fulfilled in <hi>Act.</hi> 2. The Holy Ghoſt falling down in fiery Cloven tongues in the ſight and view of the bodily eyes, which was that outward ſign; and that clear light, and fervent zeal, and love they had, in uttering the wonderful things of God in variety of ſtrange tongues, was the inward thing ſignified: So that herein the baptiſm of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt was an outward ſign, and an inward thing ſignified; but there is now no man in the world hath this baptiſm, only it is true that the Spirit, in the ſaving gifts of faith, repentance, and the like, is held to be eſſential to the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Baptiſm of water, and muſt be joined together with it, without which it cannot be ſaid to be an Ordinance of God, there muſt be the inward grace, as well as the outward ſign.</p>
            <p>This Baptiſm that the Apoſtle according to Chriſts Commiſſion hath left a ſtanding Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for, cannot be <hi>Johns</hi> baptiſm, his holding forth Chriſt to come, baptizing them in that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; But in this we baptize perſons in Chriſt already come and fully exhibited.</p>
            <p>And though it may be objected, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles practiced ſome things that were aboliſhed, as
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:42909:92"/>
the circumciſing of <hi>Timothy,</hi> and the like. We alſo ſay, that as they practiſed it among the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſo the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to the Gentiles ſaith, if they be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, Chriſt ſhould profit them nothing, but they were faln from grace: and we never find that circumciſion was practiſed among the Gentiles, that were void of all Religion before they taught them.</p>
            <p>It is evident in the new Taſtament, that Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion is aboliſhed as part of the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and yoke of bondage, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.1, 2, 3. but the caſe in baptiſm is clean otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>Whereas you hear the Apoſtle did preſs <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> his family to be baptized, who was a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile never acquainted with <hi>Johns</hi> baptiſm, nor wedded to ſuch a doctrine as that whereby we ſhould think, that <hi>Peter</hi> did baptize them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcend to that error or weakneſs in their minds.</p>
            <p>Again, he doth not only ſimply baptize them, as a Liberty that might be done or not done, but commands them to be baptized, and ſo doth, as you heard before he did, in <hi>Acts</hi> 2. and it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid, that the Apoſtles commanded any duty to be done, with a promiſe of bleſſing to the right performance of the ſame, after the Holy Ghoſt came down upon them, but it muſt needs be a ſolemn ſtanding Ordinance of God, that every ſoul upon pain of the guilt and rebellion againſt Chriſt his head and King ought to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto.</p>
            <p>But this of Baptiſm, hath as aforeſaid, many ſtanding Laws left in holy Record, ſpeaking to
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:42909:92"/>
all that believe and repent, promiſing remiſſion of ſins, and ſalvation to the right performance of the ſame, which proves it to be a ſtanding Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the new Teſtament.</p>
            <p>And truly with the ſame reaſon Souls may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that Chriſt ceaſeth to be a Mediator, as to hold the Law of dipping believers ceaſeth, ſo much and no leſs is affirmed by the Soul that ſaith, the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of baptiſm is an expired Ordinance, he may as well ſay, Chriſt is expired and aboliſhed, as a a fleſhly form, as ſome have had the confidence to ſay.</p>
            <p>For as in the time of <hi>Moſes</hi> Miniſtration, till there was a change of the Prieſthood, there could not be a change of the Law, no more now, except there be another Chriſt and Saviour come, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Prieſthood inſtead of this Prieſt and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of the New Teſtament, aſſure your ſelves, there can be no change of this Law, as in <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.12, 18. Therefore ſuch as pretend to profeſs Chriſt to be their Saviour, that came of the ſeed of <hi>David,</hi> and the ſame perſons deny and ſlight this funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Ordinance of Baptiſm, they do therein teſtify, that they reject Chriſt in their heart as aboliſhed, and have got ſome pretended fancy-Chriſt inſtead of him; It is utterly inconſiſtent with the Faith of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and with true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to hold baptiſm and the Supper two ſolemn Ordinances and Symboles of the new Covenant to be aboliſhed; for in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. the Apoſtle preſſing there a viſible Church-union layes down the main things wherein that union conſiſts, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:42909:93"/>
ſaith he, by one hope of their calling, one Spirit, one Lord, one Faith one Baptiſm this one Baptiſm, cannot be meant the Spirit, becauſe the Spirit is mentioned diſtinct, but baptiſm here muſt needs be meant that ſtanding ſolemn Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, commanded to every one that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves.</p>
            <p>Now the Apoſtle preſſing here a Church Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, doth mention theſe particulars that are eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to a viſi l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Church-union, without which they could not walk together, if not in theſe things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, and where a people in all theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars are one, no other thing coming ſhould make a breach of their union.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome other ſouls will object and ſay, <hi>That Believers baptiſm is an Ordinance of God, and he thinks they do well, that are drawn out to practiſe it, by a power from God; But ſaith the ſoul I want a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power upon my heart, drawing me out to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the ſame, and that is the let and hinderance in me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This objection is grounded upon an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and a miſtake, taking for granted, that a man may be a believer, and in a ſtate of grace, and yet void of ſpiritual power to perform obedience to the Commands of God, and that a man that is a Chriſtian may know ſuch a thing to be a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, and yet left without ability to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form obedience to the ſame.</p>
            <p>I judge this is a dangerous error and contrary to Scripture; For God doth at the very firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, put his Law in the heart of his child, as in
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:42909:93"/>
               <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10. and as in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26, 27. God is ſaid to put his Spirit in them to that end to cauſe them to walk in his waies, therefore in ſome meaſure doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs God doth give his people power to obey him, as in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 11.19, 20. I will give them one heart, and I will put a new Spirit within them, and I will take the ſtony heart out of their fleſh, and I will give them an heart of fleſh, that they may walk in my Statutes, and keep my Ordinances, and do them, and they ſhall be my people, and I will be their God.</p>
            <p>Whence you may obſerve, That Gods main drift in making his Covenant and giving his Spirit into the hearts of his people, is, that they may keep his Ordinances, and be able to walk in his waies.</p>
            <p>Therefore at the firſt Converſion of <hi>Paul,</hi> God puts in him a diſpoſition to obedience, for ſaith he, <hi>Lord what wouldst thou have me to do?</hi> in <hi>Acts</hi> 9. and ſo in <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37. when they (through the belief of <hi>Peters</hi> Sermon) were pricked at the heart, they cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, <hi>Men and Brethren, what ſhall we do?</hi> So you ſee there was a diſpoſition of heart in their firſt Converſion, to be doing what God ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and teach them to be his will; So we find God gives them power to ſubmit as ſoon as his will was revealed, for if not ſo, we ſhould lay an aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon God, that he ſhould enter into a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with a Soul by way of engagement, and yet neglect to make good his promiſe, which is, to put his Spirit in him, and to cauſe him to walk in his waies.</p>
            <p>And again further, God gives to every belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:42909:94"/>
the power of believing, by virtue of which he is enabled to fetch virtue from Chriſt his head, to ſtrengthen him to duty, and to reſiſt ſin; therefore the Apoſtle thus reaſons in the 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>Dearly Beloved, ſeeing you have theſe promiſes, let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs of fleſh and ſpirit, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting holineſs in the fear of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whence obſerve, the Apoſtle takes for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the ſoul having great and precious promiſes, and faith to draw virtue from them, ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by oppoſe ſin and perfect holineſs in the fear of God. For though it is true, God works to will and to do of his good pleaſure, yet it is conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and unfailingly his good pleaſure, thus to work more or leſs, in a ſoul that is in him, thus by faith. And a believer by faith ought to look at himſelf in a capacity to draw Water out of thoſe Wells of ſalvation; for elſe what difference between a child of God and a wicked man; the form of godlineſs and the power; if a child of God muſt be forced to live in a courſe of diſobedience to the ſolemn worſhip of God for want of power to obey. And by the ſame rule we muſt take for granted, that a child of God may be in a ſtate of Grace, and want power to reſiſt ſin, and upon this ground plead excuſe for drunkenneſs, and covetouſneſs, and theft or uncleanneſs and ſay, though he is a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, yet he wants power to reſiſt and conquer theſe ſins.</p>
            <p>Beloved, thus for any to plead, would be very abſurd and contrary to the truth, and the nature of a Chriſtian in a ſtate of grace. And further obſerve the deceit lying in this objection.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:42909:94"/>Hath not God given thy ſoul power to hear the word of God, and to read, and to meditate, and to pray, and that ſome times earneſtly and fervently to God, and is it likely that there wants power, to perform obedience to this Ordinance of baptiſm, any more than thou doeſt perform prayer or other duties which require the ſame ſpiritual power, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on due examination? what enabling power is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the one, more than in the other?</p>
            <p>Again conſider, thou doſt in this, walk by ſenſe, and not by faith (contrary to the Apoſtle 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. who ſaith, <hi>We walk by faith, not by ſight,</hi>) it is a very childiſh thing in a Chriſtian to walk by ſenſe only, when he feels ſtrength and power ſenſibly, then he thinks himſelf able to perform duty, and reſiſt ſin; but when he feels not ability and power, then to neglect it: Whereas contrary to this, Chriſt ſaith to <hi>Paul</hi> in the 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>My power ſhall be made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in your weakneſs, my grace ſhall be ſufficient for you,</hi> and as after, <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſeth himſelf, <hi>When I am weak then am I ſtrong.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When <hi>Paul</hi> was made moſt ſenſible of his own weakneſs in himſelf, then was the time for <hi>Paul</hi> to be made moſt ſtrong by Faith, in the ſtrength of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. Therefore in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 45.24. <hi>In thee Lord have I righteouſneſs and ſtrength In him ſhall they boaſt.</hi> And the Pſalmiſt ſaith in Pſalm 73 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>4. <hi>Though my heart fail and fleſh fail, yet God will never fail, he is the ſtrength of my life, and my portion for ever;</hi> So that when in a mans own ſenſe, his heart fails, his fleſh fails, then is the only time for God ſtrength to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in his weakneſs, this is the way of living by
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:42909:95"/>
faith, and the way which Gods believing children have been carryed: therefore we find <hi>Jonah</hi> when (in his own ſenſe) he was caſt out of Gods ſight, then he reſolved to look towards Gods holy Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and cryed to God out of the belly of Hell, as in <hi>Jonah</hi> 2. therefore ſurely this objection hath no weight in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome other ſoul may ſay, <hi>I grant the practice of baptiſm to be an Ordinance of God, and the way of ſuch Churches, that walk under the baptiſm of believers to be that only justifiable practice in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and could willingly walk with them and be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, were it not for their rigidneſs, in that they will have no Communion with any (though godly) that are not baptized.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this I anſwer by way of diſtinction between Church-union and Communion, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Union and Communion. Now if we find a ſoul not baptized, nor joined to any Church, and happily ignorant of baptiſm, yet if I have ground in my own heart, to judge that ſoul to be godly, and not an enemy to the truth, and Goſpel of Chriſt but a ſoul willing to hear and learn what truth God ſhall further reveal unto him, and ſo having ground to judge ſuch a ſoul to have union and perſonal communion with the Lord, in ſuch a caſe I ought to immitate the Lord in owning a Communion with ſuch a Chriſtian, in like manner, as for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his family, having a perſonal uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Lord and communion with him, before <hi>Peter</hi> preached to him, and he not being an obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:42909:95"/>
profeſſed enemy againſt any Law of Chriſt; but contrarywiſe ſaying to <hi>Peter, We are here to hear what ſoever is commanded thee of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore the Spirit of God falling down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, they ſpake with new tongues, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified God, and <hi>Peter</hi> and the ſix baptized Brethren being with them, no queſtion did join in Spirit, and heart, in that preſent Spiritual ſervice, which <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his family did perform to God, they none of them at that interim of time, being baptized nor convinced that baptiſm was an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God: For till <hi>Peter</hi> had conſulted with the Brethren, he did not preſs baptiſm upon them. And therefore we find that he did inſtruct them, after a conſultation which he had with the Bre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thren, ſaying, <hi>How ſhould we forbid water, that theſe ſhould not be baptized, that have received the Holy Ghoſt as well as we.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Paul</hi> in like manner, between the time that Chriſt had converted him, and his comming to <hi>Annanias</hi> prayed; and we find God owns a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Communion with him in that prayer; for Chriſt ſpeaking to <hi>Annanias</hi> ſaith, That Paul <hi>was a choſen Veſſel, for behold he now prayeth,</hi> manifeſting that he owned <hi>Paul</hi> in that ſervice.</p>
            <p>Now he being in a teachable godly frame (though ignorant of baptiſm) in prayer God had Communion with him. In like manner I judge from theſe Scripture examples, it is lawful for a bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized perſon to have fellowſhip in prayer or ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with any ſuch ſoul which he is perſwaded of to be godly, and that is not a profeſſed enemy to any command of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:42909:96"/>But God hath not, as we find, ever had any Church-union or Communion with any Soul, that was unbaptized; and it is clear that the Ordinance of the Supper is committed to a Church, yea to a Miniſterial Aſſembly, gathered according to Chriſts Commiſſion. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19, 20. where I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the order there binding is this: Firſt the Miniſters ſhould teach the Nations, or make them diſciples by teaching; and then the command is, Baptizing them, what them? ſuch that are made diſciples by teaching. Thirdly, the Command is to teach them to obſerve, whatſoever Chriſt hath commanded, what them is here meant, but ſuch as are made diſciples and baptized, teaching them to obſerve whatſoever I have commanded you? and I will be with you to the end of the world, that is, he will be with a people, firſt converted, ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly baptized, thirdly walking in the practical ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of all other adminiſtrations of Gods houſe, as theſe eleven did, and thoſe they conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, I ſay, this his promiſe is to be with his people to the end of the World.</p>
            <p>And this order is binding, that as a Miniſter is commanded to baptize one, made a Diſciple, and not any other, ſo he is commanded to put them upon the practical obſervation of all his Laws, and they only, and till they are baptized, they are not, nor cannot be admitted into a viſible Church, to partake of the Supper of the Lord.</p>
            <p>And that this is the true meaning of Chriſt in the Commiſſion appears, by his Apoſtles Miniſtry and practice, who by the infallible gifts of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:42909:96"/>
Ghoſt, were guided unfailingly thus to preach and practice, as in <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37, 38. with 41, and 42. verſes. Firſt he teacheth them the Doctrine of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, they hearing that were pricked at the heart, and inquiring of <hi>Peter,</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles, what they ſhould do, he ſaith, <hi>Repent and be baptized every one of you.</hi> See how he preſſeth the ſame order here, as Chriſt doth in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and afterwards in the 41. verſe, it is ſaid, <hi>So many as gladly received the word of God, were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, and the ſame day there was added to the Church about three thouſand ſouls,</hi> by Faith and Baptiſm, <hi>and they continued in the Apoſtles doctrine and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, in breaking of Bread and prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore the way that Chriſt hath ordained, is, That ſouls ſhould be joined or added to the Church by Faith and Baptiſm, according to that word in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. <hi>We are all baptized by one Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit into one body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now though the Spirit (as the inward thing ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified) be here ſpoken of, yet the outward ſign is alſo included, as might be by other Scriptures cleared. Thus <hi>Cornelius</hi> his Family were conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, then baptized, before they were conſtituted a Church.</p>
            <p>So the <hi>Gaolers</hi> and <hi>Lydia's,</hi> and the Church of <hi>Samaria</hi> in <hi>Acts</hi> 8. were all gathered by faith and dipping. And for a Miniſter to gather a Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other way is to go, not only in an untroden path, but croſs and point-blank contrary to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and practice of the Apoſtles, &amp; therby ſligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Rules of Chriſt in the Commiſſion, by
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:42909:97"/>
which the Apoſtles Doctrine and practice was gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and which all the Miniſters of the Goſpel ought to be guided by.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Why the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of Baptiſm is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred but once, the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of the Lords Supper often.</note>But yet further, the Ordinance of baptiſm is to confirm our Regeneration, New birth, and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Chriſt in his death, burial and reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3, 4 5. with <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is to be received but once, as a man is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated but once, and born but once; and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from death to life but once, but that ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, <hi>viz.</hi> the Supper is for Chriſtians growth, and increaſe of grace, and of conſtant uſe, to ſhew forth Chriſts death till he come, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be received often.</p>
            <p>Now it muſt needs be a prof<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nation of this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God, to divert and croſs the order, and ſo the ſpecial intendment of God in them; and that is, to admit perſons to that Ordinance, which is principally for Chriſtian growth before you have admitted them to that Ordinance, which is for planting them into Chriſt, ſignifying the confirmation or waſhing of Regeneration, and the new birth and Union with Chriſt the true ſtock and root from whence all ſpiritual growth is to be expected.</p>
            <p>Therefore Baptiſm muſt be the firſt Ordinance diſpenſed or adminiſtred after converſion, before the Supper. So that it would be a profanation of the Ordinances of God to divert their proper or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, end and uſe, to which our holy and jealous God hath appointed them; and it is a tender point for thoſe that profeſs themſelves friends to Chriſt,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:42909:97"/>
the Bridegroom, to be venturing to take his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar privilege or prerogative, out of his hands, as to order and diſpoſe of his own order in his ſolemn worſhip, contrary to his Commiſſion.</p>
            <p>I do judge ſuch a man that hath not a tender conſcience in ſuch caſes, is in that much unlike Chriſt, and ſhewes much carnality, becauſe, as you have heard, God will have the honor to direct his people, both for the matter and manner of their worſhip, and order of his houſe.</p>
            <p>But again as you have heard before, in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.3,<note place="margin">What things are eſſential to a Particular viſible Church.</note> 4. there is by the Apoſtle mentioned theſe things that are eſſential to a particular viſible Church-u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which are theſe,</p>
            <p>Firſt, to be <hi>all called into one hope of our calling;</hi> which the poor children which ſome admit into their ſociety by ſprinkling, are not called to the ſame hope that believers are called into.</p>
            <p>Againe, <hi>One Body, one Spirit, one Faith, one Lord, and one Baptiſm, one God and Father of us all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now it is impoſſible, that a people ſhould walk together acceptably, that have not one hope of one and the ſame glorious Inheritance, and that have not one and the ſame Spirit and aſſiſtance and guideance in his holy worſhip, and that have not one and the ſame faith, but in the doctrine of faith do mainly differ one from another, and it is an eſſential difference, inconſiſtent with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, that the members of one Church ſhould own two Baptiſms, the ſprinkling of Infants, and dipping of Believers; and this Ordinance of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is one of the eſſentials of a true viſible Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:42909:98"/>And laſtly, they are to own <hi>one God and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all;</hi> Here you have from this Text a ground why ſuch as are not inlightned in the Lords baptiſm cannot be admitted into Church-fellowſhip; becauſe in one and the ſame Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, there is to be owned as <hi>one Hope, one Spirit, one Lord, one Faith,</hi> ſo <hi>one</hi> and the ſame <hi>Baptiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again the main end of Church fellowſhip, is, That they there do practice whatſoever Chriſt hath commanded, as you have heard before in <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20. and as <hi>Cornelius</hi> ſaith in <hi>Acts</hi> 10. <hi>We are here</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to hear whatſoever it commanded thee of God;</hi> and ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Ye are my freinds if you do whatſoever I have commanded you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this is without doubt, that the true and lawfull Miniſtry in Chriſts Church, is to ſee that all the members practice the obſervation of whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he hath commanded; and ſo to ſee all the Laws of Chriſt put in execution. For that cauſe hath Chriſt given into his Church, not only the key of doctrine, but alſo the key of Diſcipline, that if any ſoul in a Church ſhall be known, wittingly or willingly, to neglect any duty that the Lord hath commanded by his holy word, eſpecially a fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Ordinance of the New Teſtament, as is Baptiſm and the Supper of the Lord, it is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all queſtion, that ſuch a ſoul, ſtanding out in that diſobedience, ought to be caſt out of the Church ſpeedily for the ſame, without which the Church allowing or conniving at, or tolerating a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oul in one courſe of known diſobedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, do therby
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:42909:98"/>
make the ſin their own, the whole people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming really guilty of his ſin and impiety. And as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Thus will the whole Lump be lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened,</hi> and that Church unchurched.</p>
            <p>Amongſt men he that concealeth murther, and is privy and conſenting to it, and will agree to tolerate it, is reckoned a murtherer; in like manner in the caſe of theft. Now the main end of Church fellowſhip and Miniſterial power is to deſtroy ſin, and to execute the power of Chriſt againſt it, and not to be foſterers and Countenancers of ſin, which you are if you agree to admit any perſon into your fellowſhip that refuſeth to ſubmit to Baptiſm, that plain ſolemn Ordinance of the New Teſtament, let his pretence be what it will be; that perſon that is not brought over to yield obedience to whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Chriſt hath commanded, is not (while ſo diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient) fit matter for a viſible Goſpel Church, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in thoſe his fundamental Ordinances, as Prayer, Hearing, Baptiſm and the Supper of the Lord, Thankſgiving, Contribution to the neceſſity of the Saints, and maintenance of an official Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery according to the ability that God gives them; and by the ſame rule, and upon the ſame ground that you will tolerate ſome members in the Church to live in the neglect of baptiſm, you muſt tolerate ſuch as neglect to hear the word, and others that will not, according to abilitie, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to pious charitable uſes; and others that will not pray in half a year or at twelve moneth toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, under the pretence they are not moved to that duty; and others that will in a groſs manner
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:42909:99"/>
neglect the duty of particular callings or relations, which the Apoſtle in <hi>Theſſal.</hi> 2. doth give rule to be withdrawn from, which is as the reſt but the neglect of duty; nay this practice lays a foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for all diſobedience, and for gathering an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of Rebels, let me alone in my ſin, and I will let thee alone in thine.</p>
            <p>But may ſome ſay, is a godly mans omitting to be baptized or dipped a ſin? Yes, certainly it is, for 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.6. the Apoſtle ſaith, ſin is a tranſgreſſion of the Law.</p>
            <p>Now you have heard ſeveral Laws of the New Teſtament do command that ſuch as believe and repent ſhould be baptized; therefore to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, is a tranſgreſſion of thoſe Laws; and ſincere obedience, is univerſal obedience, by this ſaith David, <hi>I know I ſhall not be aſhamed when I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to all thy Commandments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But further conſider, if you receive a perſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Communion,<note place="margin">Unbaptized perſons not to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into Church fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip.</note> that doth not ſubmit to the Lords baptiſm, that ſoul juſtifies ſtill a corrupt baptiſm that he had in his infancy, and conſequently is not aſhamed of all he hath done amiſs, which <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſpeaks of, but ſtill ſtands in fellowſhip and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with a Church and Miniſtry, which by the Biſhops power diſpenſed the ſame, and you recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſuch a ſoul into Communion, receive that Church and Miniſtery, from which he had his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed baptiſm, and muſt certainly own all thoſe Churches which that Miniſtery ſtood in fellowſhip with, that ſo baptized him; therefore it is a ſad and ſerious matter, who it is that is admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:42909:99"/>
fellowſhip in the true Church of Chriſt, and I would admoniſh ſouls to be careful that they do what they do in good order; for God it is ſaid made a breach upon <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah</hi> becauſe he did not do what he did in due order.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome may ſay, <hi>Faith in Christ brings a ſoul into Son-ſhip, and ſo to a right in all the privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in Gods houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Its true, Faith and Repentance doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title a ſoul; but repentance according to the Goſpel is a change of the heart, &amp; a reſolution to obey God in all his Commandments, ſuch a Repentance on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Church of Chriſt ought to own, in thoſe Members they receive. And therefore though they ought to receive the weak in faith, yet they have no rule to receive them but by faith and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm. So that though faith gives an intereſt to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, yet faith and baptiſm, are to prepare and fit a ſoul for Communion. <hi>So many as gladly received the word, were baptized, and the ſame day there were added to the Church about three thouſand ſouls, and they continued in the Apoſtles doctrine, and fellowſhip, in breaking of bread and prayer:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So here you ſee the word of Chriſt our Lord (unto whom we ought to ſubmit) that thoſe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly who were Baptized were admitted into the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of the Saints and to breaking of bread, and therefore we upon theſe grounds, may not admit any member in communion into the church of Chriſt but by baptiſm.</p>
            <p>But ſome may object and ſay, <hi>There are many godly
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:42909:100"/>
ſouls that do think they are baptized already in their infancy. And till they be convinced of that error, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not you have Church Communion with them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, I dare not ſay, but precious ſouls to God, in theſe times as well as formerly, may be (in that point) in darkneſs; I do not cenſure the caſe of ſuch. But ſure I am, that if they judge their own baptiſm or ſprinkling in their Infancy to be an Ordinance of God, they cannot but judge it a duty ſtill to practice the ſame upon their own Infants, being faithful to their principle; and then how can a church and true Miniſtry that judges dipping of believers a duty, and the other to be a grievous and provoking ſin, admit ſuch a perſon into Communion that reſolves to live not only in the neglect of a Solemn duty, but in a great and heinous ſin, in the judgement of that Church and Miniſtery, that is to admit him, which the juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Baptiſm muſt needs be?</p>
            <p>Wherfore hath Chriſt ſet up in his Goſpel church his Ordinance of Excommunication or caſting forth out of the Church, if that perſons may be admitted that are reſolved to live in both a ſin of omiſſion and commiſſion, and ſuch as have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of that ſin of ſprinkling children?</p>
            <p>So then, that perſon that lives impenitently in any one known ſin (known I mean to the Church) if that Church have communion with that perſon in that ſin, the ſin becomes the churches ſin.</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>But he liveth in this ſin through ignorance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That we preſuppoſe, or elſe the Scripture would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>end us little hopes of charity, as to his
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:42909:100"/>
good eſtate. For to knnow a ſin to be a ſin, and to live in it, doubtleſs it cannot ſtand with grace; therefore it is generally concluded that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of any Ordinance of God is damnable, but not the ſimple neglect of it, being upon ſcruples or doubts of conſcience unanſwered; but the church knows it to be a ſin, and therefore they are not to have communion with it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But may ſome ſay, <hi>I am afraid ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons do rest in Ordinances, and place that in them which is due to Chriſt only, which is ſome offence to me, and hath kept me off from that practice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is no ſound ground for this objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from either our profeſſion or practice; for we do profeſs ſalvation, juſtification and the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al welfare to be meerly of the grace of God in Chriſt, and that by faith only; and that our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Chriſt ought to be performed from a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Regeneration and union with Chriſt by faith; and anſwerable is our practice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in that we dare not put any ſoul on obedience, but from that root. For before we baptize any ſoul, we prove whether a true work of converſion be wrought in his heart or no; and whether he have union with Chriſt, and dare not admit children, becauſe that we judge that they have not a principle of Chriſt in them, from whence they ſhould ſubmit to baptiſm.</p>
            <p>And further let me ſay, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> it is eaſie for a ſoul to forbear reſting in duties, that doth not perform them. But that which is worthy in a Chriſtian, is to walk as ſtrictly in obedience to all the commands of God, as though he would be ſaved by his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:42909:101"/>
and to reſt as fully upon Chriſt and his blood, and the love of God therein revealed, as if he had done nothing at all; accounting himſelf an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable ſervant. And whereas you ſay you fear they reſt in duties; that fear and jealouſie in you (I fear) is your ſin, and poſſibly may flow from that inbred enmity and prejudice that is apt to be in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very mans heart againſt the pure waies of God. Or elſe it proceeds from the malice of the Devil ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſting ſuch thoughts into thy heart; For thou en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſt into the hearts of ſuch people, and judgeſt their very intents in this thy fear and jealouſy, and therefore beware of this ſnare.</p>
            <p>But further, ſuppoſe ſome ſouls ſhould be ſo far left of God, that walk in the practice of Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as to reſt in them, is that a ground for thee to excuſe thee, to live in a ſinful neglect of them? In a word, there can be no objection come into thy heart, tending to hinder thee from this duty, and to keep thee from thy obedience to thy Lord and King, but it muſt needs be from the fleſh or from the Devil, and therefore beware of them. Suppoſe thy judgement inclined to ſuch a Latitude, as that thou couldſt have communion with unbaptized perſons; conſider with a tender conſcience what hath been ſaid, and I hope it may much ſatisfy thee in that objection.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe thou ſhouldſt not be ſatisfied with what hath been ſaid; but ſtill judge that thy liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; thou canſt not but ſay its clear in the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, and out of doubt, that ſuch believing and being baptized ought to have Church fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:42909:101"/>
together with the practice of Ordinances; and is that a juſtifiable argument to keep thee off from communion with ſuch, as (out of doubt) thou maieſt, according to rule, have communion with, and further that thou canſt not but ſay, is thy duty to have communion with?<note place="margin">The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Chriſt muſt not be diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore I would in all tenderneſs admoniſh and warn all that fear God, to be more conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and obſerve the rules of Chriſt, and not to harbour ſuch a groſs error in thy mind, as to think thou mayſt at thy pleaſure diſpute the commands and Ordinances of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.16. ſaith, <hi>He conferred not with fleſh and blood, but he preſently obeyed the heavenly voice.</hi> And Chriſt when God by his Spirit directed him to go to the Doctors in the Temple, to hear them, and ask them queſtions, he without ſo much as acquainting his Father or Mother, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed the Lord, though to their great grief and trouble in going. And then in Phil. 2.14. our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience ſhould be without murmuring, repining or any more ado, and <hi>Luke</hi> 5.5. <hi>Peter</hi> had been fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all night and caught nothing, therefore had little hopes to catch any fiſh, yet ſaith he, <hi>At thy word I will caſt down my net;</hi> he did not diſpute the commands of Chriſt; though his own experience and ſkill did utterly teſtify againſt what Chriſt had commanded, as to ſenſe, that there could be no good effect produced, yet at thy word, ſaith he, I will caſt in my net. As <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119. <hi>I made hast to keep thy righteouſs precepts;</hi> for delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of obedience doth harden the heart, and give
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:42909:102"/>
place to the tempter: and therefore I would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice all godly ſouls to drink in this as a Maxim, that if you find an expreſs Law of Chriſt given to a believer, that it is utterly unlawful to diſpute or to queſtion the practice of it upon any pretence whatſoever, or to admit any objection againſt it; For amongſt men both in Civil and Military Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, they will not have their Laws diſputed, who may err greatly in making thoſe Laws. But our righteous God (whoſe Laws be ſure are juſt) will not have his diſputed; and therefore, as before, when Chriſt bid <hi>Peter</hi> caſt down his Net into the Sea, ſaith he, <hi>I have been all night and catched no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, yet notwithſtanding at thy word I will caſt down my net.</hi> Where obſerve, though what Chriſt commanded him, his ſkill, experience and reaſon might have ſtrongly objected againſt, yet he lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this, that there could not be any juſtifyable ground to bear him out in diſputing Chriſts Laws.</p>
            <p>And thus you have an example in <hi>Abraham</hi> in ſacrificing <hi>Iſaac,</hi> who was the promiſed ſeed, <hi>And when God called him, he followed God, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether he went;</hi> And <hi>Noah</hi> when he built an Ark for the ſaving of his houſe; And <hi>Jacob</hi> upon the command of God, carrying away his family three daies journey before <hi>Laban,</hi> and the family knew of it. There might have been much diſpute againſt theſe things, but theſe holy men of God had learned not to give place to the pride and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion of their unmortified reaſon and underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding which many ſouls, for want of more grace and ſoundneſs of judgement, give way to, in our
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:42909:102"/>
days; but they did obey the word of Gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand without any more a do, as the Apoſtles rule is, <hi>Phil.</hi>
